# ClaudeKit Marketing Documentation Update Plan

**Date**: 2025-12-30
**Branch**: feat/marketing-docs
**Type**: Documentation Enhancement
**Priority**: High

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive documentation update for ClaudeKit Marketing v1.0 to accurately reflect:
- Asset Management system (Content Hub)
- Missing core commands (/write:*, /video:*, /slide:create)
- Header navigation & routing fixes
- Corrected skills activation patterns
- Proper environment variable setup instructions

## Background

### Current State
- Docs feature Marketing kit but missing key v1 features
- Header nav only shows Engineer kit in Getting Started
- Skills activation shows incorrect `/skill:add` usage
- Commands index missing killer features (/write, /video, /slide)
- Installation instructions reference npm/node instead of ClaudeKit CLI auto-installation
- Engineers-only commands (/cook, /fix, /code, /test) listed in Marketing docs

### Target State
- Complete Marketing kit feature documentation
- Dual-kit header navigation (Engineer + Marketing)
- Accurate skill activation (implicit + explicit with prompts)
- Full command catalog including /write:*, /video:*, /slide:create, /dashboard
- Environment variable priority documentation
- Engineer-specific commands removed from Marketing docs

## Research Findings

### 1. Marketing Kit v1.0 Core Features

**Asset Management (Content Hub)**:
- Central hub for all marketing assets
- Categories: Copy, Storyboards, Slides, Infographics, Branding Guidelines, Social Posts
- Located: `/assets/` directory structure
- Screenshots: `docs/screenshots/assets-*.png` (7 files)

**Command Categories**:
1. **Content Creation** (/write:*)
   - `/write:blog` - Blog post with author style extraction
   - `/write:audit` - Content quality audit
   - `/write:publish` - Publishing workflow
   - Writing style extraction from `/assets/writing-styles/`

2. **Video Production** (/video:*)
   - `/video:create` - Full video workflow
   - `/video:script` - Script generation
   - `/video:storyboard` - Visual storyboarding
   - Uses Gemini Veo 3.1 + Imagen 4

3. **Presentation** (/slide:create)
   - Beautiful slide generation
   - Pitch decks, campaign proposals
   - `.pptx` output

4. **Dashboard** (/dashboard)
   - Asset Management UI
   - Browse markdown, reports, storyboards, images, videos
   - Screenshots: 7 PNG files showing interface

**Related Skills**:
- copywriting, content-marketing
- ai-artist, ai-multimodal
- creativity, campaign-management
- gamification-marketing, referral-program
- seo-optimization, analytics, chrome-devtools

### 2. Header Navigation Issues

**Problem**:
- `/docs/getting-started/introduction` only introduces Engineer kit
- "Docs" link → `/docs/agents` (404 - should be `/docs/engineer/agents`)
- Workflows at `/docs/workflows/` should be Engineer-specific sidebar

**Solution**:
- Update introduction.md to feature both kits
- Fix "Docs" link routing
- Move Workflows to Engineer sidebar config

### 3. Skills Activation Pattern Errors

**Current (WRONG)**:
```markdown
**Explicit**: `/skill:add analytics`
```

**Correct Pattern**:
- **Implicit**: Auto-activated by agents based on context
- **Explicit**: Prompt-based activation
  ```
  "Activate analytics, seo-optimization, and chrome-devtools skills to analyze site performance"
  ```

**Environment Variable Priority** (from skill-creator/SKILL.md):
1. Project `.env` file
2. Global `~/.env` file
3. System environment variables
4. ClaudeKit CLI sets up during `ck init`

**Installation Context**:
- Dependencies auto-installed via `ck init`
- No manual npm/node/python installation needed
- Focus docs on environment variable configuration

### 4. Commands Catalog Gaps

**Missing from Marketing docs**:
- `/write:*` family (blog, audit, publish)
- `/video:*` family (create, script, storyboard)
- `/slide:create`
- `/dashboard` (exists but needs Asset Management context)

**Should Remove** (Engineer-only):
- `/cook` (implement features - dev-focused)
- `/fix` (debugging - dev-focused)
- `/code` (implementation - dev-focused)
- `/test` (testing - dev-focused)

## Implementation Plan

   ```
   ```

2. **Update Prerequisites/Installation sections**:

### Screenshots Integration

## Quality Gates

**Before Commit**:
1. ✅ Run `bun run build` - must pass
2. ✅ Verify all internal links use absolute paths
3. ✅ Check screenshots display correctly
4. ✅ Test navigation flows
5. ✅ Validate frontmatter schema

**Content Checks**:
- [x] All new commands documented with examples (Phase 2 ✅)
- [ ] Skills activation patterns corrected (Phase 4)
- [ ] Environment variable setup clear (Phase 4)
- [x] Screenshots properly referenced (Phase 2 ✅, files missing - Phase 3 TODO)
- [x] Engineer-only commands removed from Marketing docs (Phase 2 ✅)
- [x] Both kits featured in Getting Started (Phase 1 ✅)

## Success Criteria

1. **Completeness**: All v1.0 Marketing features documented
2. **Accuracy**: Skill activation matches actual behavior
3. **Navigation**: Both kits accessible from header/Getting Started
4. **Clarity**: Environment setup clear, no manual installation confusion
5. **Build**: Zero build errors
6. **Links**: All internal links working (absolute paths)

## Risk & Mitigation

**Risk 1**: Breaking existing links
- **Mitigation**: Search all references before moving/renaming files
- **Command**: `grep -r "/docs/workflows/" src/content/docs/`

**Risk 2**: Screenshot file size
- **Mitigation**: Optimize PNGs before commit (already done, ~1MB each)

**Risk 3**: Inconsistent activation patterns
- **Mitigation**: Create reusable template for Activation sections

## Next Steps

1. **Get User Approval** on this plan
2. **Phase-by-phase implementation**
3. **Build validation** after each phase
4. **PR creation** to dev branch

## User Decisions ✅

1. ✅ **Workflows location**: Dual-kit with separate subsections
   - Engineer: `/docs/workflows/`
   - Marketing: `/docs/marketing/workflows/`

2. ✅ **Asset Management docs**: `/marketing/features/asset-management.md`

3. ✅ **Screenshots**: Embed existing 7 screenshots for now, more may be added later

---

**Estimated Total Time**: 7-11 hours
**Phases**: 5
**Files**: 22+ (7 new, 15+ updated)
**Screenshots**: 7 embedded
**Build Requirement**: Must pass before commit
**Status**: ✅ User approved, ready for implementation
