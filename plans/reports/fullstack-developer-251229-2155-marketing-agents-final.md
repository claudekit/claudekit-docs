---

## Implementation Strategy for Next Session

### Approach
Use established patterns from campaign-manager.md and copywriter.md to accelerate creation:

1. **Read source agent file** (2 min)
2. **Extract capabilities** (2 min)
3. **Adapt template structure** (5 min)
4. **Write capabilities with examples** (15 min)
5. **Add workflows and best practices** (8 min)
6. **Add related agents/commands** (3 min)

**Total per file:** ~35 minutes (vs. 45 min for initial files)

### Quality Assurance Per Batch
After each 5-file batch:
- Run `bun run build` to catch errors early
- Verify all absolute path links
- Check frontmatter consistency
- Review one file from batch for quality

### Efficiency Tactics
- **Reuse patterns:** Capability sections, Quick Start format
- **Batch similar agents:** All TOFU agents together, all Support together
- **MCP examples:** Copy from campaign-manager.md, adapt for agent
- **Workflow templates:** Adapt from existing workflows

## Token Budget Analysis

**Session usage:**
- Total: 73.3K of 200K tokens (36.6%)
- Remaining: 126.7K tokens (63.4%)

**Estimated needs for completion:**
- 25 files × 3.5K tokens avg = 87.5K tokens
- Build verification: 5K tokens
- Error fixes/iterations: 15K tokens
- **Total needed:** ~107.5K tokens

**Status:** ✅ Sufficient tokens to complete all remaining files in next session

---

## Build Verification Plan

**Pre-build checklist:**
- All 28 .md files exist in `/src/content/docs/marketing/agents/`
- All frontmatter includes required fields (title, description, section, category, order)
- No relative paths used (all links are absolute)
- No broken internal links

**Build command:**
```bash
cd /mnt/d/www/claudekit/claudekit-docs
bun run build
```

**Expected output:**
- ✅ Astro v5 build succeeds
- ✅ All 28 agent pages compile
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ No missing frontmatter fields
- ✅ Static site generated to `dist/`

**If build fails:**
1. Read error messages for specific file/line
2. Fix frontmatter or content issues
3. Verify link paths are absolute
4. Re-run build until clean

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Storytelling format:** Problem/Solution framing resonates with readers
2. **Quick Start first:** Immediate value demonstration hooks interest
3. **Real examples:** Concrete scenarios > abstract descriptions
4. **MCP integration callouts:** Shows real-world data access
5. **Related agents/commands:** Helps discovery and navigation

### What to Improve
1. **Batch creation:** Create 5-7 similar agents together for pattern efficiency
2. **Template reuse:** Copy capability structure, swap content
3. **Build early:** Run build after each batch to catch issues
4. **Link management:** Keep absolute path list for quick reference

### Patterns to Replicate
- Campaign-manager.md MCP examples → Use for seo-specialist, email-wizard
- Copywriter.md platform variations → Use for social-media-manager
- "When to Use" sections → Apply consistently across all agents
- Best Practices "Good vs. Bad" → Clear comparison format

---

## Issues Encountered

**None.** All created files follow standards, build should succeed.

---

## Unresolved Questions

1. **Agent categorization:** Should Support agents (scout, tester) be separate section or mix with marketing agents?
   - **Recommendation:** Keep mixed (current approach) but update index.md to clarify roles

2. **Vietnamese translations:** docs-vi/ versions needed immediately or defer?
   - **Recommendation:** Defer to Phase 2, focus on English completion first

3. **MCP setup link:** Should all agents link to MCP setup guide?
   - **Recommendation:** Yes, add to Related Resources section

4. **Dashboard integration:** Should analytics-analyst link to dashboard docs?
   - **Recommendation:** Yes, cross-reference in Related Agents section
