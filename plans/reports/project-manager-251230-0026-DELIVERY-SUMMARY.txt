   → Flag for Phase 06 (Internal Link Updates)

2. Do index.md files require special navigation handling?
   → Flag for Phase 02/03 if found

3. Are docs/docs/cli/* files already duplicated in docs/cli/?
   → Clarified by Step 2.14 during execution

4. Is Vietnamese filename structure identical to English files?
   → Verified by Phase 04 migration process
