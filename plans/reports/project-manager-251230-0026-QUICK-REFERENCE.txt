PHASE 01 OVERVIEW
=================
Input:  None (analysis phase)
Output: Migration manifest + signed-off validation
Next:   Phase 02 File Migration (uses this manifest)

SECTIONS AT A GLANCE
====================
A: File Verification (8 tasks)      → Verify counts match expected
B: Deep Analysis (11 tasks)         → Duplicates, CLI, special cases
C: Validation (6 tasks)             → Sign off when all checks pass

SECTION A: FILE COUNTS (PARALLEL - 2 min)
==========================================
Expected:
  Agents:        18  (in docs/docs/agents/)
  Commands:      66  (in docs/docs/commands/)
  Skills:        43  (in docs/docs/skills/)
  Configuration:  4  (in docs/docs/configuration/)
  CLI:            2  (in docs/docs/cli/)
  ────────────────
  TOTAL EN:     133

  Vietnamese:    86  (in docs-vi/docs/)
  Engineer Skills: 15 (already in docs/engineer/skills/)

Commands:
  find src/content/docs/docs/agents -name "*.md" | wc -l        # expect 18
  find src/content/docs/docs/commands -name "*.md" | wc -l      # expect 66
  find src/content/docs/docs/skills -name "*.md" | wc -l        # expect 43
  find src/content/docs/docs/configuration -name "*.md" | wc -l # expect 4
  find src/content/docs/docs/cli -name "*.md" | wc -l           # expect 2
  find src/content/docs/docs -name "*.md" | wc -l               # expect 133
  find src/content/docs-vi/docs -name "*.md" 2>/dev/null | wc -l # expect 86
  find src/content/docs/engineer/skills -name "*.md" 2>/dev/null | wc -l # expect 15

SECTION B1: SKILLS DUPLICATES (3 min)
======================================
Command:
  # Extract legacy skills filenames
  find src/content/docs/docs/skills -name "*.md" -exec basename {} \; | sort > /tmp/legacy-skills.txt

  # Extract engineer skills filenames
  find src/content/docs/engineer/skills -name "*.md" -exec basename {} \; | sort > /tmp/engineer-skills.txt

  # Find duplicates
  comm -12 /tmp/legacy-skills.txt /tmp/engineer-skills.txt

Decision Matrix (if duplicates found):
  ☐ Keep legacy version (will overwrite)
  ☐ Keep existing version (skip migration)
  ☐ Merge content manually (review conflict)

SECTION B2: CLI FILES (2 min)
=============================
Command:
  echo "=== CLI in docs/docs/cli/ ==="
  find src/content/docs/docs/cli -name "*.md" -exec echo {} \;

  echo "=== CLI in docs/cli/ ==="
  find src/content/docs/cli -name "*.md" -exec echo {} \;

Decision (RECOMMENDED: Option A):
  ☐ Option A: Move to /docs/cli/ (merge with existing 9)
  ☐ Option B: Move to /docs/engineer/cli/
  ☐ Option C: Per-file review

SECTION B3: SPECIAL CASES (2 min)
==================================
Commands:
  # Find index files
  find src/content/docs/docs -name "index.md" -exec echo {} \;

  # Find section:docs samples (first 5)
  grep -r "section: docs" src/content/docs/docs | head -5

  # Find custom slug files
  grep -r "slug:" src/content/docs/docs | head -5

Document all findings in manifest.

SECTION C: VALIDATION (2 min)
=============================
Checklist (ALL must PASS):
  [ ] Total English = 133? (sum of 18+66+43+4+2)
  [ ] Total Vietnamese = 86? (count from docs-vi/docs/)
  [ ] Engineer skills = 15? (count from docs/engineer/skills/)
  [ ] No blocking duplicate conflicts? (from B1 analysis)
  [ ] All decisions documented? (CLI, skills, special cases)
  [ ] Migration manifest created? (aggregated results)

If ALL pass → SIGN OFF and proceed to Phase 02

Issue: Duplicates found but unclear how to merge
Fix:   Review file content, decide per-file, document in manifest

Issue: Custom slugs found
Fix:   Document in manifest, flag for Phase 06 link updates

Issue: Index files found
