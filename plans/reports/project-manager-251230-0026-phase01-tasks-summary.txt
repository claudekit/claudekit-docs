Step 2.6  | Verify total English files (expect 133)
Step 2.7  | Verify Vietnamese file count (expect 86)
Step 2.8  | Verify existing engineer skills (expect 15)

SECTION B: DEEP ANALYSIS (11 tasks - 2.9 to 2.19)
-------------------------------------------------
B1: SKILLS DUPLICATE ANALYSIS
Step 2.9  | Extract legacy skills filenames from docs/docs/skills/
Step 2.10 | Extract existing engineer skills filenames
Step 2.11 | Find duplicate filenames (comm -12)
Step 2.12 | Document skills merge decision (keep-legacy/keep-existing/merge)

B2: CLI FILES ANALYSIS
Step 2.13 | List CLI files in docs/docs/cli/ with paths
Step 2.14 | List CLI files in docs/cli/ with paths
Step 2.15 | Decide CLI migration: Option A (merge to /docs/cli/) recommended

B3: SPECIAL CASES & FRONTMATTER
Step 2.16 | Find index.md files in docs/docs tree
Step 2.17 | Find files with section: docs (sample 5)
Step 2.18 | Find files with custom slug: field
Step 2.19 | Document all special cases and frontmatter variations

SECTION C: VALIDATION & DELIVERABLES (6 tasks - 3.1 to 3.6)
-----------------------------------------------------------
Step 3.1  | Verify total English file count = 133
Step 3.2  | Verify total Vietnamese file count = 86
Step 3.3  | Verify existing engineer/skills files = 15
Step 3.4  | Confirm no blocking duplicate conflicts found
Step 3.5  | Create migration manifest with all results
Step 3.6  | Sign off Phase 01 validation checklist

DEPENDENCIES
============
CRITICAL PATH (Sequential):
  2.3 → 2.9 → 2.11 → 2.12 → 3.4 → 3.5 → 3.6

PARALLEL OPPORTUNITIES:
  • Steps 2.1-2.8 (all file counts can run in parallel)
  • Steps 2.13-2.15 with B1 tasks
  • Steps 2.16-2.19 with any section

AMBIGUITIES & DECISION POINTS
==============================
1. CLI migration location (Step 2.15)
   - Option A: /docs/cli/ (RECOMMENDED)
   - Option B: /docs/engineer/cli/
   - Option C: Per-file review

2. Skills duplicate handling (Step 2.12)
   - Keep legacy version (overwrite)
   - Keep existing version (skip migration)
   - Merge content manually

3. Index files impact (Step 2.16)
   - Unknown: Do index.md files affect nav components?

4. Custom slug preservation (Step 2.18)
   - Assumption: Custom slugs preserved during git mv

5. Vietnamese missing files (Phase 04)
   - 47 files missing (133 - 86 = 47)
   - Out of scope Phase 01

REQUIRED TOOLS & SKILLS
=======================
Tools:
  ✓ find command (file discovery)
  ✓ grep command (pattern search)
  ✓ wc -l (counting)
  ✓ comm (find duplicates)
  ✓ sort (ordering)
  ✓ bash shell (execution)
  ✓ Git (version control)

Skills:
  • Bash scripting (intermediate)
  • File system navigation (basic)
  • Frontmatter parsing (basic)
  • Problem analysis (intermediate)
  • Documentation (intermediate)

EXECUTION TIMELINE
==================
Section A (File Verification):  2 minutes
Section B (Analysis):           8 minutes
Section C (Validation):         2 minutes
Buffer:                         -2 minutes (actual: 10 min total)
TOTAL ESTIMATED:                10 minutes

VALIDATION SUCCESS CRITERIA
===========================
Phase 01 passes when ALL 6 checks pass:
  ✓ Total English files = 133
  ✓ Total Vietnamese files = 86
  ✓ Existing engineer/skills = 15
  ✓ No blocking duplicate conflicts
  ✓ Migration manifest created
  ✓ Special cases identified

RISKS
=====
Risk                          | Severity | Mitigation
File counts don't match       | MEDIUM   | Recount, check paths
Duplicates found (unresolved) | MEDIUM   | Manual review per-file
Custom slug handling unclear  | MEDIUM   | Document in Step 2.19
Hidden files affect count     | LOW      | None - find gets all .md

DELIVERABLES
============
1. ✓ File count verification report
2. ✓ Skills duplicate list (or "No duplicates")
3. ✓ CLI files decision documented
4. ✓ Special cases documentation
5. ✓ Migration manifest (/tmp/migration-manifest.txt)
6. ✓ Phase 01 validation sign-off

NEXT STEPS
==========
IF VALIDATION PASSES:
  → Proceed to Phase 02: File Migration (English)
  → Duration: 30 minutes
  → Method: git mv for all files
  → Input: Migration manifest from Phase 01

IF ISSUES FOUND:
  → Stop and resolve before Phase 02
  → Document in separate ticket
  → Flag blocker to team

UNRESOLVED QUESTIONS
====================
1. Should custom slugs be preserved or remapped during migration?
2. Do index.md files affect navigation components needing updates?
3. Have the 2 docs/docs/cli files already been duplicated in docs/cli/?
4. Are Vietnamese files named identically to English files?

STATUS
======
Report: Ready for Execution
Tasks: 26 extracted and formatted
Checklist: Created in TodoWrite
Approval: Awaiting execution
