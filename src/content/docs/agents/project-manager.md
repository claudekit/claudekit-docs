## Best Practices

### Do's ✅

**Regular Updates**
```bash
✓ Review progress daily
✓ Update roadmap weekly
✓ Collect agent reports continuously
✓ Generate summaries at milestones
```

**Proactive Monitoring**
```bash
✓ Track blockers immediately
✓ Identify risks early
✓ Communicate timeline changes promptly
✓ Escalate critical issues
```

**Clear Communication**
```bash
✓ Use consistent report format
✓ Provide actionable insights
✓ Include metrics and data
✓ Highlight both successes and issues
```

### Don'ts ❌

**Delayed Updates**
```bash
✗ Wait until end of week for updates
✗ Let roadmap become stale
✗ Ignore minor timeline slips
```

**Incomplete Tracking**
```bash
✗ Miss agent reports
✗ Forget to update roadmap
✗ Overlook quality metrics
```

**Poor Communication**
```bash
✗ Vague status updates
✗ Missing context in reports
✗ No recommendations provided
```

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Roadmap Out of Date

**Symptoms**: Roadmap doesn't reflect current state

**Solutions:**
1. Review git commits since last update
2. Collect latest agent reports
3. Update completed/in-progress sections
4. Adjust timelines based on velocity

**Command:**
```bash
/watzup  # Generates comprehensive update
```

### Problem: Missing Agent Reports

**Symptoms**: Reports directory incomplete

**Solutions:**
1. Check agent execution logs
2. Verify report file naming convention
3. Manually request reports from agents
4. Update documentation triggers

**File Check:**
```bash
ls -la plans/reports/YYMMDD-*
```

### Problem: Velocity Tracking Inaccurate

**Symptoms**: Estimates don't match actual time

**Solutions:**
1. Review historical velocity data
2. Adjust story point estimates
3. Account for complexity factors
4. Update planning assumptions

**Analysis:**
```markdown
Historical velocity:
- Week 40: 18 points
- Week 41: 17 points
- Week 42: 20 points

Average: 18.3 points
Use for future planning
```

## Integration with Other Agents

### Receives Reports From

**All Agents**:
```
planner → Implementation plans
scout → File discoveries
debugger → Issue diagnoses
tester → Test results
code-reviewer → Review reports
docs-manager → Documentation updates
git-manager → Commit summaries
```

### Delegates To

**docs-manager**:
```
project-manager: "Update roadmap"
↓
docs-manager: Updates project-roadmap.md
```

**planner**:
```
project-manager: "Create Phase 3 plan"
↓
planner: Creates detailed implementation plan
```

### Coordinates With

**All Agents** for:
- Timeline alignment
- Resource allocation
- Priority setting
- Risk management

## Important Notes

### Always Update Roadmap

**CRITICAL**: Must update roadmap after:
- Feature implementations
- Milestones
- Bug fixes (critical/high)
- Security updates
- Weekly reviews

### Report File System

**Convention**: `./plans/reports/YYMMDD-from-[agent]-to-[agent]-[task]-report.md`

**Example**: `251030-from-planner-to-pm-auth-research-report.md`

### Delegation to docs-manager

**Never directly updates documentation**:
- ✅ Identifies documentation needs
- ✅ Delegates to docs-manager
- ❌ Never edits docs directly

**Exception**: Only updates `project-roadmap.md`

## Next Steps

Learn more about related topics:

- [Docs Manager](/docs/agents/docs-manager) - Documentation management
- [Git Manager](/docs/agents/git-manager) - Version control operations
- [Planner](/docs/agents/planner) - Implementation planning

**Key Takeaway**: The project-manager agent provides comprehensive project oversight through implementation analysis, progress tracking, report collection, and roadmap maintenance while delegating specialized tasks to appropriate agents.
