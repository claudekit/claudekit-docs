# /content:fast

Generate creative and effective copy quickly. This command produces multiple variations optimized for different platforms and use cases, perfect when you need quality content fast.

## Syntax

```bash
/content:fast [content request]
```

## How It Works

The `/content:fast` command follows a rapid content generation workflow:

### 1. Request Analysis

- Understands content type needed
- Identifies target audience
- Determines tone and style
- Recognizes platform requirements

### 2. Quick Research (optional)

- Reviews similar successful content (if reference provided)
- Checks platform best practices
- No deep competitive analysis (use `/content:good` for that)

### 3. Rapid Generation

Invokes **copywriter** agent to create:
- Multiple variations (3-5)
- Platform-optimized formatting
- Different angles/approaches
- Appropriate length for platform

### 4. Quick Delivery

Delivers content within seconds:
- Ready-to-use copy
- Multiple options to choose from
- Basic formatting applied
- Character counts included

## Examples

launch, target audience: senior developers and engineering managers,
tone: professional but excited]
```

‚ùå **Vague:**
```bash

```

### Request Multiple Variations

/content:fast [write 5 email subject line variations for product launch]
```

## Quality vs Speed Trade-off

### /content:fast (This command)

```
Speed: ‚ö°‚ö°‚ö°‚ö°‚ö° 5-15 seconds
Quality: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ Very good
Research: Minimal
Variations: 3-5 options
Use case: Quick content needs
```

### /content:good

```
Speed: ‚ö°‚ö°‚ö°‚òÜ‚òÜ 2-5 minutes
Quality: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Excellent
Research: Comprehensive
Variations: Multiple with rationale
Use case: Strategic content
```

## Common Patterns

### Product Announcement

```
Structure:
1. Hook (what's new)
2. Key benefit
3. Supporting details (2-3 bullets)
4. Social proof (if available)
5. Clear CTA
```

### Feature Highlight

```
Structure:
1. Pain point identified
2. How feature solves it
3. Specific benefit/outcome
4. Quick example
5. Try it CTA
```

### Company Milestone

```
Structure:
1. The milestone (users, funding, etc.)
2. What it means
3. Thank supporters
4. What's next
5. Join us CTA
```

## Troubleshooting

### Content Not Right Tone

**Problem:** Generated content doesn't match brand voice

**Solution:**
```bash
/content:fast [same request, but use professional and technical tone
like our brand voice in ./docs/brand-voice.md]
```

### Too Long for Platform

**Problem:** Generated content exceeds character limit

**Solution:**
```bash
/content:fast [same request, but keep under 280 characters for Twitter]
```

### Need More Variations

**Problem:** Want more options to choose from

**Solution:**
```bash
/content:fast [generate 10 variations instead of 5]
```

### Content Too Generic

**Problem:** Needs more specificity

**Solution:**
```bash
# Add specific details to request
/content:fast [same request but include that we have 50,000 users
and reduced coding time by 70% in beta testing]
```

## After Generation

Standard workflow:

```bash
# 1. Generate content
/content:fast [content request]

# 2. Review variations
cat content/fast/[type]-[timestamp].md

# 3. Pick favorite (or combine elements)

# 4. Customize if needed

# 5. Use in platform

# 6. Track performance
# (Engagement, clicks, conversions)
```

## Iteration

If first attempt isn't perfect:

```bash
# Original
/content:fast [write LinkedIn post about feature]

# Review output
# "Too formal, need more excitement"

# Iterate
/content:fast [write LinkedIn post about feature, but more excited
and use emojis, target developers not managers]
```

## Time Savings

Typical time to write manually vs `/content:fast`:

```
Social media post:    10 min ‚Üí 8 sec   (75x faster)
Email subject lines:  20 min ‚Üí 6 sec   (200x faster)
Ad copy variations:   30 min ‚Üí 9 sec   (200x faster)
Product description:  15 min ‚Üí 5 sec   (180x faster)
Headlines:           25 min ‚Üí 7 sec   (214x faster)
```

## Next Steps

- [/content:good](/docs/commands/content/good) - For strategic content with research
- [/content:enhance](/docs/commands/content/enhance) - Improve generated content
- [/content:cro](/docs/commands/content/cro) - Optimize for conversion

---

**Key Takeaway**: `/content:fast` generates quality copy in seconds with multiple variations optimized for different platforms, perfect when you need effective content quickly without compromising quality.
