- Various hooks and structures
- Platform-optimized formatting

### 4. Detailed Rationale

For each variation provides:
- Strategic reasoning
- Target audience fit
- Psychological triggers used
- Expected effectiveness
- When to use each version

### 5. A/B Testing Recommendations

Suggests testing strategy:
- Which variations to test
- What metrics to track
- Test duration recommendations
- Expected performance ranges

## Examples

### Strategic Blog Post

```bash
/content:good [write blog post about AI code review benefits for engineering teams]
```

**What happens:**
```
Agent: copywriter + researcher

Selected: A

Body:

Hi [First Name],

Quick question: How much time did you spend writing
tests last week?

If it's more than 2 hours, we have good news.

ClaudeKit now writes your tests automatically.

Unit tests. Integration tests. E2E tests. All generated
from your code in seconds.

Sarah's team tried it yesterday. Generated 247 tests
in 18 minutes. 94% coverage.

Want to try? It takes 30 seconds to set up:
[Quick Start Guide]

Happy testing (well, happy not testing 😄)
[Your name]

P.S. First 1,000 users get Pro features free for 30 days.

(153 words, 2 min read, 1 primary CTA)

Rationale:
+ Opens with relatable question
+ Quantifies pain (time spent)
+ Introduces solution clearly
+ Real example with metrics
+ Easy CTA (30-second setup)
+ PS creates urgency


EMAIL 2: The Deep Dive
---
(Sent 3 days later to non-openers and openers who didn't click)

Subject: "How ClaudeKit generated 247 tests in 18 minutes"

Body:

Hey [First Name],

Remember Sarah's team from our last email?

Here's the full story of their first week with
AI-powered testing...

[Day 1]: Generated 247 tests in 18 minutes
[Day 3]: Found 8 bugs before production
[Day 7]: Achieved 94% test coverage

"We used to dread writing tests. Now it's automatic."
- Sarah Chen, Engineering Lead @ TechCorp

How it works:
1. Install ClaudeKit CLI (1 command)
2. Run: claudekit test generate
3. Review generated tests
4. Commit and push

That's it. No configuration. No prompt engineering.

Watch it in action: [3-min demo video]

Or try it yourself: [Start free trial]

[Your name]

P.S. Our Pro features trial ends in 4 days. Don't miss it.

---
(168 words, includes video CTA alternative)

Rationale:
+ Continues Sarah's story (narrative thread)
+ Provides specific timeline
+ Includes testimonial with attribution
+ Shows simplicity (3 steps)
+ Two CTAs (watch or try)
+ PS reinforces urgency


EMAIL 3: The Urgency Push
---
(Sent 4 days after Email 2, to non-converters)

Subject: "Your Pro trial expires in 24 hours ⏰"

Body:

[First Name],

Quick heads up: Your free Pro trial expires tomorrow.

After that, AI testing returns to the waitlist.

What you'll lose access to:
❌ Automatic test generation
❌ E2E test creation
❌ 95%+ coverage guarantee
❌ Priority support

What you keep:
✓ Manual test writing
✓ Weekend debugging sessions
✓ Low test coverage stress

Just kidding (mostly) about the last two 😅

But seriously—500+ teams already activated their tests.

The setup takes 30 seconds.
The time saved: 20+ hours/month.

Ready? [Activate AI Testing Now]

Not for you? No problem. [Give us feedback]

[Your name]

P.S. Reactivating later means joining the waitlist.
Do it now while you can.

+ Social proof (500+ teams)
+ ROI reminder (20+ hours/month)
+ Easy out (feedback link)
+ PS reinforces consequences

Phase 4: A/B Testing Recommendations

Test A: "Watch demo" vs "Try it yourself"
Expected: "Try it" wins (lower friction)

Email 3 Send Time:
Test A: 9am vs 2pm
Expected: 9am wins (checked morning)

Sequence performance targets:
- Email 1 open rate: 35-45%
- Email 2 open rate: 25-35%
