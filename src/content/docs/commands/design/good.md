## Troubleshooting

### Takes Too Long

**Problem:** Design process taking longer than expected

**Solution:**
- Consider `/design:fast` for non-critical pages
- Focus quality on high-impact pages only
- Iterate: start fast, upgrade to good later

### Need Revisions

**Problem:** Design doesn't match vision

**Solution:**
```bash
# Be specific about changes
/design:good [revise hero section - make headline more prominent, reduce CTA button size, use purple gradient instead of blue]

# Provide reference
/design:good [update pricing section to match this style: [reference-image.png]]
```

### Performance Issues

**Problem:** Animations causing lag

**Solution:**
```bash
/fix:ui [optimize animations - reduce complexity while maintaining smooth feel]
```

## Next Steps

- [/design:fast](/docs/commands/design/fast) - Quick prototypes first
- [/design:describe](/docs/commands/design/describe) - Analyze award winners
- [/design:3d](/docs/commands/design/3d) - Add 3D elements
- [/fix:ui](/docs/commands/fix/ui) - Polish final details
