## What is ClaudeKit?

ClaudeKit extends Claude Code with specialized toolkits for engineering and marketing. Instead of writing prompts from scratch, you call workflows optimized for speed and quality.

### Two Powerful Toolkits

**Engineer Kit** - Development & automation toolkit:
- **Agents**: Specialized AI assistants (planner, researcher, tester, debugger, backend-developer)
- **Commands**: Development workflows (`/cook`, `/fix`, `/plan`, `/test`, `/code`)
- **Skills**: Technical knowledge modules (Next.js, PostgreSQL, Docker, DevOps)

**Marketing Kit** - Marketing & content automation toolkit:
- **Agents**: Content creators (copywriter, ui-ux-designer, campaign-manager, seo-specialist)
- **Commands**: Marketing workflows (`/write:blog`, `/video:create`, `/slide:create`, `/campaign:*`)
- **Asset Management**: Centralized hub for copy, storyboards, slides, brand guidelines
- **Skills**: Marketing expertise (copywriting, SEO, analytics, video production)

## How It Works

**Engineer Kit Example:**
1. Type `/cook "add user authentication"`
2. System launches planner → researcher → developer → tester
3. Agents collaborate, write code, run tests, commit changes
4. You review results, provide feedback, iterate

**Marketing Kit Example:**
1. Type `/write:blog "introducing our new API"`
2. System extracts your writing style from `/assets/writing-styles/`
3. Copywriter agent drafts blog matching your tone
4. Content saved to Asset Management hub for reuse

## Why Use ClaudeKit?

**For Engineers:**
- **Speed**: 10x faster than manual prompting for feature development
- **Quality**: Battle-tested workflows reduce bugs and technical debt
- **Consistency**: Same development patterns across entire team

**For Marketers:**
- **Brand Consistency**: Centralized asset management ensures unified messaging
- **Context Awareness**: Content based on actual product/codebase
- **Production Ready**: Video storyboards with Gemini Veo 3.1, slides in .pptx format
