## Why It Works

### Living System, Not Dead Code
Traditional boilerplates are snapshots in time. ClaudeKit improves with every Claude update. Your dev team gets smarter automatically.

### Tech Stack Agnostic
Works with your existing codebase. Next.js today, migrate to Django tomorrow. No lock-in.

### Full Lifecycle
Not just code generation. **Plan → Research → Implement → Test → Review → Document → Commit**. Complete workflow, not fragments.

### Real ROI
**First feature**: 10 hours saved at $100/hr = $1,000 value
**Cost**: $99 one-time
**Net profit day 1**: $901
