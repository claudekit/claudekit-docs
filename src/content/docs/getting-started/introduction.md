# Introduction

**Ship Production Features in Hours, Not Weeks**

ClaudeKit Engineer is a multi-agent AI system built on Claude Code that handles the complete software development lifecycle. Instead of giving you static boilerplate code, ClaudeKit provides 12 specialized AI agents that collaboratively plan, code, test, review, and deploy features.

## What is ClaudeKit?

ClaudeKit is an AI development team alternative to traditional boilerplates. Rather than starting with outdated templates, you get intelligent agents that:

- **Understand Your Stack** - Works with Next.js, Django, Laravel, Go, Rust, or any tech stack
- **Learn Your Patterns** - Adapts to your project through CLAUDE.md configuration
- **Ship Production Code** - Delivers production-ready features, not just templates
- **Evolve Automatically** - Improves continuously with Claude model updates

## 12 Specialized Agents

ClaudeKit provides a complete AI development team:

### Planning & Research
- **Planner** - Creates detailed implementation plans with multiple approaches
- **Researcher** - Investigates technologies, best practices, and documentation
- **Project Manager** - Coordinates agents and tracks progress

### Development
- **UI/UX Designer** - Creates interface designs, wireframes, and design systems
- **Database Admin** - Handles database queries, optimization, and migrations
- **Copywriter** - Writes compelling, conversion-focused content

### Quality Assurance
- **Tester** - Runs tests, validates features, and checks coverage
- **Code Reviewer** - Reviews code quality, security, and best practices
- **Debugger** - Investigates issues and analyzes system behavior

### Operations
- **Git Manager** - Handles commits, pull requests, and version control
- **Docs Manager** - Maintains technical documentation and standards
- **Journal Writer** - Documents technical difficulties and learnings

## Why ClaudeKit?

### Not a Boilerplate
Traditional boilerplates lock you into specific tech stacks and become outdated quickly. ClaudeKit works with your existing codebase and any technology.

### Production-Ready
Generate AI-powered visual assets, write conversion-optimized copy, and ship features that work in production - capabilities no static template can provide.

### Time Savings
Save 10+ hours on your first feature. Focus on business logic while AI agents handle the implementation details.

- **Solo Developers** - Get an entire development team without hiring
- **Indie Makers** - Ship faster and validate ideas quickly
