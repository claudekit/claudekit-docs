# Attraction Specialist

> **Your growth accelerator** - Turn search traffic into qualified leads with data-driven TOFU content

## What This Agent Does

You've got great content, but no one's finding it. Your competitors are ranking for keywords you didn't know existed. Your landing pages convert at 2% when the industry average is 5%. Sound familiar?

**The Problem**: Most teams treat lead generation like throwing spaghetti at the wall. They write content without keyword research, build landing pages without conversion frameworks, and wonder why traffic doesn't convert.

**The Solution**: The Attraction Specialist is your senior growth marketer who specializes in top-of-funnel content strategy. This agent performs keyword gap analysis against competitors, creates high-converting landing page copy, designs programmatic SEO templates for scalable content, and generates lead magnet ideas that actually attract qualified leads.

This agent uses proven frameworks from successful SaaS growth teams, combining SEO best practices with conversion rate optimization principles to create content that ranks and converts.

```bash
# Step 1: Identify your top 3 competitors
/scout "Who are the main competitors for [your product]"

# Step 2: Request keyword analysis
/ask "Analyze keyword gaps between us and [competitor domains]"

# The agent will:
# - Research competitor keyword rankings
# - Identify gaps where they rank and you don't
# - Prioritize by search volume and difficulty
# - Map keywords to buyer journey stages
# - Recommend content strategy
```

**Output**: Prioritized keyword list with volume, difficulty, intent, and recommended content type.

### Workflow 2: Landing Page Creation

/ask "Create landing page copy for [product/offer] targeting [audience]"

# The agent will generate:
# - Hero headline with benefit-driven subheadline
# - Value proposition framework
# - Feature-to-benefit translations
# - Social proof section structure
# - CTA copy with urgency elements
```

**Output**: Complete landing page copy with conversion optimization notes.

### Workflow 3: Programmatic SEO Strategy

Scale your content production:

```bash
# Define your template type
/ask "Design a programmatic SEO template for [location/comparison/integration] pages"

# The agent creates:
# - Template structure with variables
# - H1/H2/meta tag templates
# - Internal linking schema
# - JSON-LD structured data
# - Content brief for writers
```

**Output**: Reusable template that scales to 100+ pages.

## Best Practices

1. **Start With Research**: Never create content without understanding what's already ranking. Use the agent's competitive analysis to inform your strategy.

2. **Prioritize By Impact**: Focus on keywords with the best volume-to-difficulty ratio. The agent scores opportunities so you can focus on wins.

3. **Match Search Intent**: Use the agent's intent mapping to ensure your content matches what searchers actually want. Informational intent needs different content than transactional intent.

4. **Test Everything**: Use the agent's landing page frameworks as starting points, then A/B test headlines, CTAs, and value propositions to optimize conversion.

5. **Think Systems, Not Pages**: Use programmatic SEO templates to build content systems that scale, not one-off pages.

## MCP Integrations

The Attraction Specialist can integrate with external tools when configured:

- **ReviewWebsite MCP**: Live keyword data, competitor content analysis, backlink research
- **Google Ads MCP**: Real keyword performance data and search volume insights

When MCP servers are unavailable, the agent falls back to manual research methods.
