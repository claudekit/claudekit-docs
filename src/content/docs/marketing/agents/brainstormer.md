# Brainstormer

> Your strategic thinking partner who challenges assumptions and finds the best path forward before you commit resources.

## What This Agent Does

**The Problem**: You've got a marketing idea. Maybe it's brilliant. Maybe it's expensive. Maybe it's both. But here's the thing - you won't know until you've shipped it, spent the budget, and watched the results trickle in. By then, it's too late to pivot.

Bad strategy decisions waste months and burn budgets. Every marketing team has war stories about campaigns that seemed genius in the kickoff meeting but flopped in execution.

**The Solution**: Brainstormer is your strategic debate partner who helps you think through marketing decisions before you commit. Instead of guessing, you explore multiple angles, challenge assumptions, evaluate trade-offs, and arrive at validated strategies backed by research and reasoning.

Think of it as having a senior marketing strategist who asks the hard questions, researches best practices, and helps you avoid expensive mistakes.

## Quick Start

30-second example - evaluate a campaign idea:

```
You: "We want to launch on Product Hunt next month. Is this the right move?"

brainstormer: Let me help explore this decision systematically...

Discovery Questions:
→ What's your goal? (Traffic, signups, brand awareness, feedback?)
→ Do you have an engaged community ready to upvote?
→ Is your product polished enough for public scrutiny?
→ Have you prepared supporting content (demo, video, landing page)?
→ What's your backup plan if it doesn't hit front page?

Research Findings:
✓ Top launches average 500+ upvotes in first 3 hours
✓ Hunter with 1K+ followers increases visibility 3x
✓ Tuesday-Thursday launches perform 40% better than Monday/Friday
✓ Products with demo videos get 2x engagement

Approaches to Consider:

Option A: Full Launch (High Risk, High Reward)
Pros: Maximum exposure, press coverage, credibility boost
Cons: One shot only, requires significant prep, public failure risk
Best if: You have community momentum, polished product, hunter lined up

Option B: Soft Launch (Lower Risk, Learning Opportunity)
Pros: Test messaging, gather feedback, iterate before big push
Cons: Less visibility, won't make "Product of the Day"
Best if: Product still has rough edges, community building in progress

Option C: Skip Product Hunt, Focus on Paid Launch
Pros: Controlled timing, targeted audience, predictable results
Cons: Higher cost, less organic reach, no PH badge
Best if: Budget available, niche audience, time-sensitive launch

My Recommendation:
Given you're asking in December with January launch target, I'd suggest Option B (soft launch) in January to test, then Option A (full launch) in February with Product Hunt hunter partnership.

Why: 60 days gives you time to build community, polish product based on soft launch feedback, and coordinate with a hunter. January soft launch reduces risk while providing real-world validation.

Next Steps:
1. Define success metrics (what makes this worth doing?)
2. Audit product readiness (screenshot tour, demo video, landing page copy)
3. Research potential hunters in your niche
4. Build pre-launch email list (aim for 500+ interested users)

Questions to resolve:
→ What's your current email list size?
→ Do you have an existing community (Discord, Twitter)?
→ What's your monthly marketing budget?
```

## Capabilities

### 1. Strategic Questioning

Ask the right questions to uncover what really matters.

**Example:**
```
You: "Should we sponsor DevConf 2025?"

brainstormer: Let's think through this systematically...

Critical Questions:
→ What's the goal? (Brand awareness, leads, partnerships, recruiting?)
→ How much is the sponsorship? ($5K, $25K, $100K tier?)
→ Who attends? (Your target audience or adjacent?)
→ What's included? (Booth, speaking slot, logo placement?)
→ How will you measure ROI?
→ What's your conversion assumption? (X attendees → Y leads → Z customers)

Let me research DevConf attendee profiles and typical sponsor ROI...

[After research]

Key Findings:
→ DevConf draws 3,000 attendees (mostly backend devs, 60% senior+)
→ Average sponsor reports 150 booth conversations, 40 qualified leads
→ Speaking slot sponsors see 3x more engagement
→ $25K tier includes booth + 20min talk + logo on site

Quick ROI Math:
Cost: $25,000
Expected leads: 40 qualified (industry avg)
Your close rate: 10% (assume conservative)
Expected customers: 4
Your ACV: $12,000
Revenue: $48,000
ROI: 1.92x (92% return in year 1)

But here's what the numbers don't show:
→ Brand visibility to 3K decision-makers
→ Content from your talk (YouTube, blog, social)
→ Partnership conversations with other sponsors
→ Recruiting opportunities (devs looking for new roles)

My Take:
If you can deliver a compelling 20min talk and staff the booth with senior team members who can have technical conversations, it's worth the investment. If you're just showing up with a banner and junior SDRs, skip it.

Alternative: Consider smaller, niche conferences where you can be a headline sponsor for 1/3 the cost and own more mindshare.
```

### 2. Multi-Option Analysis

Present multiple viable paths with honest trade-offs.

**Example:**
```
You: "We need to grow our email list faster"

brainstormer: Let's explore your options...

Approach 1: Lead Magnet Upgrade
Strategy: Create high-value downloadable (ebook, template, toolkit)
Effort: 2-3 weeks (Medium)
Cost: $2K-5K (designer, writer)
Expected Result: 500-1,500 new subscribers/month
Pros: One-time effort, evergreen asset, builds authority
Cons: Requires content creation, needs promotion budget

Approach 2: Viral Loop / Referral Program
Strategy: Incentivize existing subscribers to refer friends
Effort: 1 week (Low if using tool like Viral Loops)
Cost: $500-1K/mo (tool + rewards budget)
Expected Result: 20-40% monthly growth from referrals
Pros: Compounds over time, self-sustaining, engaged audience
Cons: Needs existing base, requires reward budget, slow start

Approach 3: Strategic Partnerships
Strategy: Co-marketing with complementary products (guest posting, co-webinars)
Effort: Ongoing (High)
Cost: $0 (time only)
Expected Result: 300-800 new subscribers per partnership
Pros: Zero cost, targeted audience, relationship building
Cons: Time-intensive, inconsistent results, dependent on partners

Approach 4: Paid Acquisition (LinkedIn/Twitter Ads)
Strategy: Run targeted lead gen campaigns
Effort: 1 week setup, ongoing optimization (Medium)
Cost: $2K-10K/mo depending on scale
Expected Result: 200-500 subscribers/mo per $5K spend
Pros: Predictable, scalable, fast results, controllable
Cons: Expensive, stops when budget stops, requires optimization

Approach 5: Content SEO Play (Long-term)
Strategy: Publish SEO-optimized content targeting commercial intent keywords
Effort: 3-6 months (High)
Cost: $3K-8K/mo (writer, SEO specialist)
Expected Result: 1,000-3,000 organic subscribers/mo (after 6mo)
Pros: Compounds forever, high-quality leads, low marginal cost
Cons: Slow payoff, requires expertise, competitive

My Recommendation (Combo Strategy):
→ Month 1-2: Quick win with Approach 2 (referral program) + Approach 3 (2 strategic partnerships)
→ Month 3+: Invest in Approach 5 (SEO content) for long-term growth
→ Only use Approach 4 (paid ads) if you have budget and can afford 6+ month payback period

Why this combo:
→ Referral program activates existing audience (fastest ROI)
→ Partnerships bring targeted, engaged subscribers (low cost)
→ SEO content builds long-term moat (best lifetime value)
→ Lead magnet can be created in Month 2 to support SEO content

What's your current email list size and monthly growth rate?
```

### 3. Risk Assessment

Identify what could go wrong before you commit.

**Example:**
```
You: "We're considering a $50K influencer partnership"

brainstormer: Let's stress-test this decision...

Risk Analysis:

1. Audience Mismatch Risk (HIGH)
   → Their audience: 500K followers
   → Your target: B2B SaaS buyers
   → Risk: Followers may be curiosity-seekers, not buyers
   → Mitigation: Request audience analytics, look at engagement quality
   → Red flag: If <5% engagement rate or mostly consumer audience

2. Brand Alignment Risk (MEDIUM)
   → Risk: Influencer past content could conflict with your brand values
   → Mitigation: Deep background check, review 12 months of content
   → Red flag: Controversial takes, promotes competitors, inconsistent quality

3. Performance Risk (HIGH)
   → Risk: $50K with unclear success metrics
   → Mitigation: Structure deal with performance clauses
   → Alternative: $10K base + $40K bonus tied to conversions
   → Red flag: Influencer won't agree to performance terms

4. Fake Engagement Risk (MEDIUM)
   → Risk: Purchased followers, bot engagement
   → Mitigation: Analyze follower quality (use Social Blade, HypeAuditor)
   → Red flag: Sudden follower spikes, generic comments, high follower:low engagement

5. One-Hit Wonder Risk (HIGH)
   → Risk: $50K for single post, zero long-term value
   → Mitigation: Negotiate content series + usage rights
   → Better deal: 4 posts over 3 months + repurposing rights for ads

Expected ROI Calculation:
Best case: 50K reach → 2.5K clicks → 250 signups → 25 customers → $300K revenue (6x ROI)
Realistic: 50K reach → 1K clicks → 80 signups → 8 customers → $96K revenue (1.9x ROI)
Worst case: 50K reach → 300 clicks → 15 signups → 1 customer → $12K revenue (0.24x ROI)

Questions Before You Commit:
→ Have they successfully promoted similar products?
→ Can you speak with 2-3 past brand partners?
→ Will they provide you with campaign analytics?
→ What's included? (Story, post, video, usage rights?)
→ What if performance is weak - any refund/redo clause?

Alternative: Test First
Instead of $50K:
→ Spend $5K on 3 micro-influencers (10-50K followers each)
→ Measure performance across different audience segments
→ Double down on what works

My recommendation: Don't commit $50K until you've validated influencer channel works for you at smaller scale.
```

### 4. Research-Backed Recommendations

Ground strategies in data and best practices.

**Example:**
```
You: "What's the best way to launch our new product feature?"

brainstormer: Let me research successful SaaS feature launches...

[Researches: SaaS launch case studies, marketing best practices, competitor analysis]

Research Findings:

1. Launch Timing (Source: ProductLed study, 2024)
   → Tuesday 10am EST = highest engagement (31% open rate)
   → Avoid Mondays (inbox overload) and Fridays (weekend mode)
   → Holiday weeks see 40% lower engagement

2. Multi-Touch Approach (Source: Intercom, SaaS Launches Report)
   → Single email = 12% awareness
   → Email + in-app + social = 67% awareness
   → Average touches needed: 4-7 across 2 weeks

3. Messaging Hierarchy (Source: Amplitude Product Marketing)
   → Lead with outcome, not feature ("Ship 10x faster" not "New AI assistant")
   → Show before tell (demo video > feature list)
   → Address skepticism early ("Yes, it actually works in production")

4. Successful Launch Patterns:
   → Teaser phase (1 week before): Build anticipation, early access list
   → Launch day: Email + in-app banner + social + blog post
   → Follow-up (Week 1): Use case content, customer stories
   → Sustained (Week 2-4): Webinar, tutorials, community showcases

Recommended Launch Plan:

Week 1 (Pre-Launch):
→ Monday: Teaser email to power users ("Something big is coming...")
→ Wednesday: Preview video on social, early access signup
→ Friday: Behind-the-scenes content, founder story

Week 2 (Launch Week):
→ Tuesday 10am: Launch email with demo video
→ Tuesday 10am: In-app banner for all active users
→ Tuesday 11am: Social posts (Twitter, LinkedIn)
→ Tuesday 2pm: Blog post goes live
→ Thursday: Follow-up email with use cases

Week 3-4 (Sustain):
→ Week 3: Customer success stories, webinar invite
→ Week 4: Tutorial content, comparison chart (new vs old way)

Content Assets Needed:
✓ 90-second demo video
✓ Launch email (3 variations for A/B test)
✓ In-app announcement banner
✓ Blog post (1,500 words with screenshots)
✓ Social posts (10 variations for testing)
✓ FAQ document
✓ Webinar slides

Budget Estimate:
→ Video production: $2K-5K
→ Copywriting: $1K-2K
→ Design assets: $1K
→ Webinar platform: $500
→ Total: $4.5K-8.5K

Expected Results (based on SaaS benchmarks):
→ Email open rate: 28-35%
→ Feature adoption (Week 1): 15-25% of active users
→ Feature adoption (Month 1): 40-60% of active users
→ Support tickets spike: +30% in Week 1 (plan for this)

Risk Factors:
→ If feature has learning curve, adoption will be slower
→ If feature requires workflow change, expect resistance
→ Plan onboarding content and support resources accordingly

### 5. Assumption Challenging

Question what seems obvious to uncover better paths.

**Example:**
```
You: "We need to be on TikTok to reach developers"

brainstormer: Let's challenge that assumption...

Your assumption: "Developers are on TikTok"

Reality check:
→ TikTok dev community exists (~2M #devtok tag)
→ BUT: Skews younger (18-24), junior devs, student coders
→ Your target: Senior devs (30-45), decision-makers, budget holders

Question: Are the developers ON TikTok the ones who BUY your product?

Let me compare channel audience fit:

TikTok:
Audience: Junior devs, students, early career
Content: Quick tips, memes, coding challenges
Engagement: High (viral potential)
Buying intent: Low (not decision-makers)
Effort: High (constant content creation)
ROI timeline: Long (6-12 months to build audience)

LinkedIn:
Audience: Senior devs, eng managers, CTOs
Content: Thought leadership, case studies, technical deep-dives
Engagement: Lower volume, higher quality
Buying intent: High (budget holders, evaluating tools)
Effort: Medium (2-3 posts/week)
ROI timeline: Fast (3-6 months)

Dev.to / Hashnode:
Audience: Practicing developers, all levels
Content: Technical tutorials, architecture insights
Engagement: Medium (thoughtful discussions)
Buying intent: Medium (influencers, not always buyers)
Effort: Medium (1 deep post/week)
ROI timeline: Medium (6-9 months, SEO benefits)

YouTube:
Audience: Developers learning, evaluating tools
Content: Tutorials, reviews, comparisons
Engagement: Medium (subscribers, comments)
Buying intent: High (actively researching solutions)
Effort: High (video production)
ROI timeline: Long (12+ months, but compounds)

Alternative Hypothesis: "We need to be where developers MAKE BUYING DECISIONS"

That's probably:
1. Google (searching for solutions)
2. LinkedIn (researching tools professionally)
3. Developer communities (asking for recommendations)
4. YouTube (watching comparisons and tutorials)

Not TikTok.

Counter-question: Why do you think you need TikTok?

Common reasons (and my response):
→ "Competitors are there" → Are they getting customers from it?
→ "It's trending" → Trending ≠ effective for B2B SaaS
→ "Reach younger devs" → Are younger devs your buyers?
→ "Easy to go viral" → Viral views ≠ paying customers

My Recommendation:
Skip TikTok unless:
→ Your product is free/freemium with bottoms-up adoption
→ You're targeting junior devs who become advocates
→ You have a creator who's passionate about it (not forced)

Instead, focus on:
→ LinkedIn for decision-maker awareness
→ SEO content for high-intent searches
→ YouTube for product education and comparison

Better question: "What channel has the best intent-to-effort ratio for reaching senior developers who have budget?"

5. brainstormer helps plan phased rollout with metrics
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Ask "Why?" Three Times

Don't accept surface-level reasoning.

**Example:**
"We need to be on TikTok"
→ Why? "Competitors are there"
→ Why does that matter? "They're getting engagement"
→ Why do you think engagement = customers? "..."

### 2. Define Success Before Strategy

**Bad:** "Let's launch on Product Hunt"
**Good:** "Let's drive 1,000 signups via Product Hunt launch, success = 500+ upvotes and 30+ feedback comments"

Specific goals shape strategy.

### 3. Budget for Reality, Not Best Case

Assume 50-70% of projected results.

If you need 1,000 leads and projection says 1,500, build the plan assuming 1,000. Better to overdeliver.
