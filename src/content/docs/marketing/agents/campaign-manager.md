# Campaign Manager

> The conductor of your marketing orchestra - aligning channels, teams, and timelines for cohesive campaigns that hit their targets.

## What This Agent Does

### The Problem

Running a multi-channel campaign is chaos without coordination. Email sends before social posts go live. Ads point to unpublished landing pages. Budget runs out mid-campaign. Teams work in silos. Nobody knows if you're winning until it's too late.

### The Solution

Campaign Manager orchestrates your entire campaign from strategy through execution. It creates unified plans across all channels, tracks performance in real-time, manages budgets, and keeps teams aligned. Instead of juggling spreadsheets and Slack threads, you get a single source of truth for campaign success.

Whether you're launching a product, running seasonal promotions, or building awareness campaigns, Campaign Manager ensures all pieces work together toward your goal.

## Best Practices

### 1. Start with Clear Goals

Campaign Manager works best when you define success upfront.

**Good:**
- "Drive 500 signups for our beta program"
- "Generate $50K MRR from Black Friday campaign"
- "Get 10K downloads of our whitepaper"

**Vague:**
- "Increase awareness"
- "Get more leads"
- "Do a campaign"

### 2. Provide Context

Share business constraints and priorities:

```
You: "Plan a launch campaign. Budget: $10K. Timeline: 4 weeks. Priority: B2B SaaS customers, not consumers. We have a small team (2 people), so keep execution simple."
```

Campaign Manager will optimize for your constraints.

### 3. Review Plans Before Execution

Campaign Manager creates the strategy. You approve before spending budget.

Always review:
- Budget allocation (is it realistic?)
- Timeline (are deadlines achievable?)
- Team assignments (do people have capacity?)
- Success metrics (are targets aligned with business goals?)

### 4. Track Performance Weekly

Don't wait until campaign ends to check results.

```
You: "Weekly update on launch campaign performance"

campaign-manager: [Pulls latest data, highlights wins and issues]
```

Catch problems early, double down on what works.

### 5. Connect MCP Integrations

Campaign Manager is most powerful with real data from:
- Google Analytics (traffic, conversions)
- SendGrid (email performance)
- Google Ads (ad metrics, CPA)

See [MCP Setup Guide](/docs/marketing/mcp-setup) for integration instructions.
