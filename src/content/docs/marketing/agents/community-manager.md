# Community Manager

> Your community director who builds thriving, engaged communities that turn members into advocates and customers.

## What This Agent Does

**The Problem**: You launched a Discord server. Or a Slack community. You've got 200 members. Most are lurkers. A few power users dominate conversations. New members join and never say a word. You're not sure if the community is healthy or dying slowly.

Communities feel like work. Moderating, engaging, answering the same questions repeatedly, dealing with spam and negativity. You wanted a thriving community. You got a ghost town with occasional drama.

**The Solution**: Community Manager is your experienced community director who analyzes sentiment, drafts engagement strategies, creates moderation systems, surfaces insights, generates FAQs from common questions, and builds programs that turn lurkers into active, valuable members.

Think of it as having a dedicated community professional who understands what makes online communities thrive.

## Quick Start

## When to Use Community Manager

**Perfect for:**
- Discord/Slack community management
- Sentiment analysis and health monitoring
- Member engagement strategies
- Moderation system design
- FAQ creation from conversations
- Community event planning

**Not needed for:**
- Social media management (use Social Media Manager)
- One-on-one customer support (use support team)
- Long-form content creation (use Content Creator)
- Campaign execution (use Campaign Manager)

## Example Workflows

### Workflow 1: Community Health Check

```
1. You: "Analyze our Discord community health"

2. community-manager: Comprehensive audit
   - Analyzes activity rates
   - Tracks sentiment trends
   - Identifies power users
   - Finds engagement gaps
   - Spots concerning patterns

3. Output:
   FINDINGS:
   → Activity rate: 18% (target: 40%)
   → New member retention: 22% (low)
   → Power user concentration: 68% (high)
   → Sentiment: 6.8/10 (positive but declining)

   RECOMMENDATIONS:
   → Fix onboarding flow (+78% first message rate)
   → Create FAQ from common questions
   → Launch monthly events
   → Recognize power users publicly

4. You implement recommendations

5. Activity improves +94% over 60 days
```

### Workflow 2: Crisis Management

```
1. You: "Members are angry about price increase"

2. community-manager: Sentiment analysis
   - Identifies negative threads
   - Analyzes complaint themes
   - Drafts response template
   - Suggests mitigation strategy

3. Output:
   SEVERITY: High (8 angry members, sentiment dropping)

   RESPONSE TEMPLATE:
   "We hear you and acknowledge we should have communicated this better..."

   ACTIONS:
   → Public apology in #announcements
   → DM affected users individually
   → Grandfather existing users on old pricing
   → Add 30-day notice for future changes

4. You respond publicly + individually

5. Sentiment recovers within 48 hours
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Welcome Every New Member

**Bad:** New members join silently
**Good:** Auto-welcome + prompt to introduce themselves

First impression matters. Make it welcoming.

### 2. Respond Fast, Especially to Questions

**Bad:** Answer when you have time (8+ hours)
**Good:** Respond within 2 hours, even if just "Looking into this"

Speed signals you care.

### 3. Celebrate Member Wins

**Bad:** Ignore when members share successes
**Good:** Celebrate publicly, ask to feature them

Recognition breeds more engagement.
