# Content Creator

> **Your creative production engine** - Transform strategies into compelling content across every channel

## What This Agent Does

You have a content strategy but no one to execute it. Your blog posts are dry and don't rank. Your social media posts get ignored. Your ad copy sounds like everyone else's. Your video scripts ramble. You need content but don't have time to write it all yourself.

**The Problem**: Creating high-quality content across multiple formats is time-consuming and requires different skills. Blog writing is different from social media, which is different from video scripts, which is different from ad copy. Most teams either produce low-quality content quickly or high-quality content too slowly.

**The Solution**: The Content Creator is your senior marketing writer who produces compelling, brand-aligned content across all formats. This agent writes SEO-optimized blog posts, creates engaging social media content, develops video scripts, crafts high-converting ad copy, generates landing page copy, and produces newsletter content—all while maintaining consistent brand voice and quality.

This agent applies best practices specific to each format and platform, ensuring content is optimized for where it will be published.

## Quick Start

Create your first piece of content in 30 seconds:

```bash
# Generate a blog post
/ask "Write a blog post about [topic] targeting [audience]"

# The agent creates complete, ready-to-publish content
```

## Capabilities

### Blog Posts

Create SEO-optimized articles that rank and convert. The agent writes comprehensive articles with proper keyword optimization, develops thought leadership pieces that establish authority, creates how-to guides with clear instructions, writes engaging listicles that get shared, and crafts detailed case studies with results.

**Example**: A 1,500-word article on "10 Email Marketing Mistakes" with H2/H3 structure, target keyword naturally integrated 8 times, internal links to related content, meta description, and strategic CTAs every 300 words.

### Social Media Posts

Create platform-specific content that engages. The agent writes Twitter/X threads that tell stories, creates LinkedIn posts optimized for the algorithm, develops Instagram captions with hooks, designs TikTok video concepts, crafts Facebook posts for different audiences, and builds hashtag strategies that increase reach.

### Video Scripts

Write scripts that keep viewers watching. The agent creates explainer video scripts with clear structure, develops product demo narratives that sell, writes testimonial video outlines, crafts short-form social video scripts (15-60 seconds), and designs webinar content with engagement hooks.

### Ad Copy

Write ads that convert across platforms. The agent writes Google Ads copy with extensions, creates Facebook/Instagram ad variations, develops LinkedIn sponsored content, crafts retargeting ad copy, and tests multiple headline variations for optimization.

### Landing Page Copy

Convert visitors with persuasive page copy. The agent writes compelling hero sections that hook immediately, crafts benefit statements that resonate, creates feature descriptions that sell outcomes, designs CTA copy that drives clicks, and builds proof sections with testimonials and social proof.

### Newsletter Content

Keep subscribers engaged with valuable emails. The agent writes engaging openers that get read, creates value-packed content people share, designs segment-specific messaging, crafts promotional content that doesn't feel salesy, and builds re-engagement copy for inactive subscribers.

## Best Practices

1. **Match Format to Platform**: Twitter copy won't work on LinkedIn. The agent optimizes for each platform's algorithm and audience expectations.

2. **Hook First 3 Seconds**: Whether it's a blog post intro or video script, the first few seconds determine if people keep reading/watching. The agent prioritizes strong hooks.

3. **Write for Scanning**: Most people skim. Use short paragraphs, bullet points, bold text, and clear headers. The agent formats for quick reading.

4. **Include Clear CTAs**: Every piece of content should have a purpose and clear next step. The agent strategically places CTAs throughout.

5. **Maintain Brand Voice**: Content should sound like your brand across all formats. The agent references `docs/brand-guidelines.md` for voice and tone consistency.

6. **Optimize for SEO (Where Relevant)**: Blog posts, landing pages, and some social content benefit from SEO optimization. The agent includes keywords naturally.
