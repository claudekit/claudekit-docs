# Continuity Specialist

> **Your customer retention guardian** - Keep customers active, engaged, and loyal for maximum lifetime value

## What This Agent Does

Your customer churn rate is 8% monthly, bleeding revenue faster than you acquire it. You don't know which customers are at risk until they cancel. Your re-engagement attempts are generic and ineffective. You have no systematic way to identify happy customers for testimonials. Customer lifetime value is low because people don't stick around.

**The Problem**: Most companies focus all their energy on acquiring new customers and ignore retention. They don't monitor customer health, have no early warning system for churn, and only react after someone cancels. The result? High churn, low LTV, and constant pressure to acquire more customers just to stand still.

**The Solution**: The Continuity Specialist is your customer retention strategist who keeps customers engaged and loyal. This agent identifies churn risk patterns before customers leave, designs re-engagement campaigns that win back inactive users, automates NPS surveys with proper follow-up, creates testimonial request sequences that generate social proof, builds customer health scoring models, and analyzes lifecycle stages to optimize retention at every phase.

This agent uses proven retention frameworks from high-performing SaaS companies to maximize customer lifetime value through proactive engagement.

## Quick Start

Assess your retention health in 30 seconds:

```bash
# Analyze churn risk
/ask "Identify customers at risk of churning and recommend interventions"

# The agent analyzes engagement patterns and flags at-risk accounts
```

## Capabilities

### Churn Risk Detection Patterns

Predict who will churn before they do. The agent identifies early warning signals in behavior (declining usage, reduced logins, feature abandonment), tracks engagement decline over time, monitors usage patterns vs. successful customers, detects at-risk segments by cohort or persona, and builds prediction models based on historical churn patterns.

**Example**: The agent identifies that customers who don't use Feature X within first 30 days have 67% churn vs. 8% for those who do, creating an intervention trigger.

### Re-engagement Campaign Design

Win back inactive customers systematically. The agent creates win-back sequences for dormant accounts, designs reactivation offers that incentivize return, plans multi-channel outreach (email, in-app, SMS), builds urgency triggers without being pushy, and develops personalized messaging based on previous behavior.

### NPS Automation Workflows

Turn feedback into action and advocacy. The agent designs survey triggers based on usage milestones, creates feedback loops that route responses correctly, plans follow-up actions for each score range, builds promoter programs that generate referrals and reviews, and handles detractor responses with retention playbooks.

### Testimonial Request Sequences

Generate social proof from happy customers. The agent identifies happy customers at peak satisfaction moments, times requests strategically (after wins, not problems), designs ask templates that increase yes rate, creates review workflows for multiple platforms, and builds case study pipelines that turn customers into advocates.

### Customer Health Scoring

Monitor account health in real-time. The agent defines health metrics (usage, engagement, support tickets, NPS), weights engagement factors by predictive power, sets alert thresholds for intervention, creates intervention triggers for declining health, and builds dashboard frameworks for CS teams to monitor.

### Lifecycle Stage Analysis

Optimize retention at every stage. The agent maps complete customer journeys from signup to renewal, identifies stage transitions and what triggers them, plans stage-specific messaging and engagement, designs milestone communications that celebrate progress, and tracks lifecycle velocity (how fast people progress).

## Example Workflows

### Workflow 1: Churn Risk Analysis

Identify who's at risk and why:

```bash
# Step 1: Analyze churn patterns
/ask "Analyze our churn patterns and identify predictive signals"

# The agent will examine:
# - Usage patterns before churn
# - Engagement decline indicators
# - Feature adoption gaps
# - Support ticket patterns
# - NPS score trends
# - Time-to-churn by segment

# Step 2: Score current customers
# Agent applies patterns to identify at-risk accounts

# Step 3: Get intervention recommendations
# Agent suggests:
# - High risk: Personal outreach + value demonstration
# - Medium risk: Re-engagement email + feature tutorial
# - Low risk: Check-in survey + resource sharing
```

**Output**: Churn risk report with scored customers and intervention playbook.

### Workflow 2: Customer Health Score Model

Build predictive health scoring:

```bash
# Design health score
/ask "Create a customer health scoring model for [your product]"

# The agent will define:

# Demographic Score (20%):
# - Company size: [points by tier]
# - Industry fit: [points by vertical]
# - Plan level: [points by tier]

# Usage Score (40%):
# - Login frequency: [points by frequency]
# - Feature adoption: [points per feature]
# - Daily active usage: [points by threshold]

# Engagement Score (30%):
# - Email opens: [points]
# - Resource downloads: [points]
# - Community participation: [points]

# Support Score (10%):
# - Ticket count: [negative points]
# - Satisfaction: [positive points]
# - Resolution time: [factor]

# Thresholds:
# - Healthy: 75-100 (green)
# - At-risk: 50-74 (yellow)
# - Critical: 0-49 (red)
```

**Output**: Complete health scoring model with implementation guide.

### Workflow 3: Re-engagement Campaign

Win back inactive customers:

```bash
# Create win-back sequence
/ask "Design a re-engagement campaign for customers inactive for 60+ days"

# The agent creates multi-touch sequence:

# Email 1 (Day 0): "We miss you"
# - Subject: "Is everything okay with [product]?"
# - Content: We noticed you haven't logged in
# - Offer: Personal check-in or demo refresh

# Email 2 (Day 3): "What's new"
# - Subject: "You've missed some exciting updates"
# - Content: New features since they left
# - Offer: Quick tutorial or walkthrough

# Email 3 (Day 7): "Special offer"
# - Subject: "Come back - here's what we can do"
# - Content: Limited-time incentive
# - Offer: Discount, extended trial, or bonus

# Email 4 (Day 14): "Last chance"
# - Subject: "Before you go..."
# - Content: Why they originally signed up
# - Offer: Final opportunity

# Non-responders: Mark for list cleanup
```

**Output**: Complete re-engagement sequence with copy and timing.

### Workflow 4: NPS Program Design

Automate feedback and follow-up:

```bash
# Build NPS workflow
/ask "Design an NPS automation workflow with proper follow-up"

# The agent creates:

# Survey Triggers:
# - 30 days after signup (onboarding feedback)
# - 90 days after signup (feature feedback)
# - Post-support interaction (service feedback)
# - Annual (relationship feedback)

# Follow-up by Score:

# Promoters (9-10):
# - Thank you message
# - Request review (G2, Capterra)
# - Request testimonial
# - Offer referral incentive
# - Add to case study pipeline

# Passives (7-8):
# - Thank you message
# - Ask what would make it a 10
# - Offer resources or training
# - Follow up in 60 days

# Detractors (0-6):
# - Immediate escalation to CS
# - Personal outreach within 24h
# - Offer problem-solving session
# - Create retention ticket
# - Follow up until resolved
```

**Output**: Complete NPS automation with branching logic and templates.

## Best Practices

1. **Monitor Health Continuously**: Don't wait for annual surveys. The agent's health scoring allows real-time monitoring and proactive intervention.

2. **Intervene Early**: By the time someone says they're leaving, it's often too late. Use the agent's early warning signals to act when retention is still possible.

3. **Segment Interventions**: Not all at-risk customers need the same approach. High-value accounts get personal outreach, lower-value accounts get automated sequences.

4. **Close the Feedback Loop**: When customers give feedback (especially detractors), act on it and follow up. The agent designs workflows that ensure no feedback goes unaddressed.

5. **Celebrate Milestones**: Use lifecycle analysis to identify achievement moments (first 100 users, 1-year anniversary) and celebrate them. This increases emotional connection.

6. **Make Unsubscribe Easy**: Paradoxically, making it easy to leave increases retention. People appreciate honesty and are more likely to stay when not held hostage.
