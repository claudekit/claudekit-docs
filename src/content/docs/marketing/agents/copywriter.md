# Copywriter

> Words that sell. Copy that converts. Messages that make people stop, read, and act.

## What This Agent Does

### The Problem

Most marketing copy is forgettable. Generic headlines that blend into feeds. Vague value props that don't differentiate. Weak CTAs that don't inspire action. Your product might be amazing, but if your words don't grab attention in 3 seconds, nobody will ever know.

Bad copy costs you customers. Every day.

### The Solution

Copywriter is an elite conversion specialist who crafts words that stop scrolls, drive clicks, and turn browsers into buyers. Whether you need landing page headlines, email subject lines, social posts, or ad copy, Copywriter applies psychological triggers, platform best practices, and proven frameworks to make every word count.

No corporate jargon. No AI slop. Just honest, compelling copy that feels human and gets results.

## Quick Start

30-second example - write a hero headline:

```
You: "Write hero copy for our AI code assistant landing page"

copywriter: I'll craft conversion-focused headlines...

Primary Version:
"Stop Writing Boilerplate. Start Shipping Features."

Subheadline:
"Your AI dev team builds what takes you hours - in 6 minutes. Authentication, payments, APIs. Production-ready code that actually works."

Alternative Versions:
1. "Ship in 6 Minutes What Takes 6 Hours to Build"
   → Focus: Speed, time savings, instant gratification

2. "Your AI Team Writes Code. You Ship Features."
   → Focus: Role shift, outcome over process

3. "Skip the Stack Overflow Rabbit Hole. Claude Builds It For You."
   → Focus: Pain point (research paralysis), direct solution

Rationale:
- Primary leads with action, promises outcome
- "Boilerplate" resonates with devs (universal pain)
- "Start Shipping" = desired outcome
- Subheadline quantifies benefit (6 min vs hours)
- Specificity builds credibility (auth, payments, APIs)
- "Actually works" addresses skepticism

A/B Test Recommendations:
- Test emotional vs. rational headlines
- Test time savings vs. outcome focus
- Test specificity levels in subheadline

Link Verification: ✓ All URLs tested (none in this copy)
```

## Capabilities

### 1. Platform-Specific Copy Mastery

Adapt voice and format for each platform's algorithm and audience behavior.

**Example - Twitter/X:**
```
You: "Write a tweet announcing our new AI feature"

copywriter:

Tweet (Primary):
We just shipped AI code review that actually catches bugs before deploy.

Not "might help."
Not "suggests improvements."

Catches bugs. Saves deploys. Ships in your CI/CD.

Try it: [link]

Why This Works:
- First line = bold claim (pattern interrupt)
- "Not X, Not Y" = anti-hype positioning
- Short sentences = scannable, punchy
- Ends with clear CTA
- No hashtags (they kill engagement)
- Under 280 chars (mobile-friendly)

Alternative (Social Proof Angle):
1,247 devs shipped code today without a single P0 bug.

Their secret? AI code review that runs before merge.

Same AI that caught:
- Auth bypass in production
- Memory leak in checkout
- SQL injection in user input

Your turn: [link]
```

**Example - LinkedIn:**
```
You: "Announce our AI assistant on LinkedIn"

copywriter:

I've reviewed 10,000+ pull requests in my career.

The same bugs appear over and over:
→ Unhandled errors that crash production
→ SQL queries without parameterization
→ Auth checks that skip edge cases

Last month, we built AI that catches these before code review.

It found 247 bugs across 50 repos in week 1.
Bugs that would've hit production.
Bugs that would've woken up on-call engineers at 3am.

The best part? It runs in CI/CD. No workflow change. No new tools.

Just fewer bugs, faster deploys, better sleep.

We're opening beta access: [link]

Why This Works (LinkedIn-specific):
- Starts with personal story (builds credibility)
- First 2 lines hook before "see more" fold
- Data-driven (numbers, specifics)
- Professional tone but not corporate
- Relatable pain points (3am pages)
- Soft CTA (beta access, not hard sell)
```

### 2. Psychological Trigger Application

Use proven frameworks to drive action.

**Example - FOMO Formula:**
```
You: "Create urgency for our Black Friday sale"

copywriter:

Limited Spots Email:

Subject: 47 spots left (Black Friday early access)

Preview: This is the only warning you'll get before we close the doors...

Body:
We opened Black Friday early access 6 hours ago.

853 people claimed their spot.
47 spots remain.

After that? You wait until Friday like everyone else.
(And pay 40% more)

Early access gets you:
→ Best pricing of the year (60% off)
→ Bonus: 1-on-1 onboarding ($500 value)
→ First access to new features for 12 months

This closes when we hit 900.
Or midnight tonight.
Whichever comes first.

Claim your spot: [link]

Psychological Triggers Used:
✓ Scarcity (47 spots left)
✓ Social proof (853 claimed)
✓ Loss aversion (pay 40% more later)
✓ Urgency (dual deadline: 900 or midnight)
✓ Exclusive access (bonuses, features)
✓ Specific numbers (not "limited" but "47")

Ethical Check: ✓ Real scarcity (actual spot limit)
```

### 3. A/B Test Frameworks

Design variations that test specific hypotheses.

**Example:**
```
You: "Create email subject line variations to test"

copywriter:

Campaign: Product launch announcement
Goal: Maximize open rates

Test Matrix (5 variations):

Control (Baseline):
"Introducing our new AI code assistant"
Hypothesis: Straightforward announcement

Variation A (Curiosity):
"This writes code faster than you do"
Hypothesis: Bold claim drives curiosity opens

Variation B (Benefit):
"Ship features in 6 minutes, not 6 hours"
Hypothesis: Time savings beats feature announcement

Variation C (Question):
"Still writing auth from scratch?"
Hypothesis: Question creates cognitive gap, drives opens

Variation D (Social Proof):
"1,200 devs shipped code today using this"
Hypothesis: Herd behavior drives FOMO opens

Variation E (Urgency):
"Early access closes in 48 hours"
Hypothesis: Deadline beats announcement

Sample Size Needed:
- Minimum 1,000 sends per variation (5K total)
- 95% confidence, 20% lift detection
- Expected winner: Variation B or C (benefit or question)

Next: Run for 24 hours, declare winner, send remainder to winner
```

### 4. Conversion Framework Mastery

Apply proven structures for persuasion.

**Example - PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solution):**
```
You: "Write landing page copy using PAS framework"

copywriter:

Landing Page: AI Code Assistant

[Problem]
Headline: "You're Spending 60% of Dev Time on Boilerplate"

Subheadline: Authentication. Payment processing. API integrations. CRUD endpoints. The same code you've written 100 times. It's not creative work - it's copying Stack Overflow and hoping it works.

[Agitate]
And when it doesn't work?

→ Your sprint slips another week
→ Junior devs copy-paste code they don't understand
→ Security bugs slip into production
→ You explain to your PM why "simple auth" took 3 days

You know there's a better way.
You just haven't found it yet.

[Solution]
Headline: "Your AI Team Writes the Boring Code. You Ship the Features."

ClaudeKit builds production-ready code in 6 minutes:
→ Full auth system (email, OAuth, 2FA) - 6 min
→ Stripe payments with webhooks - 8 min
→ REST API with validation - 5 min
→ Tested, documented, deployed - 0 min (automatic)

Not code snippets. Not suggestions.
Complete, working systems you'd spend days building.

[CTA]
Start Your Free Trial
→ No credit card required
→ Takes 2 minutes to set up
→ Ship your first feature today
```

### 5. Brand Voice Adaptation

Maintain consistency while optimizing for conversion.

**Example:**
```
You: "Write product copy that matches our brand voice"

copywriter: Reading brand guidelines from docs/brand-guidelines.md...

✓ Brand voice: Professional but approachable, results-focused
✓ Tone: Peer-to-peer (developer to developer)
✓ Avoid: Hype, exaggeration, corporate jargon
✓ Use: Specific results, honest claims, technical credibility

Copy (Brand-Aligned):

"ClaudeKit builds production code in 6 minutes.

Not prototypes. Not boilerplate.
Production-ready features with tests, docs, and deploys.

The same features that take you 6 hours to build.
We just automated the boring parts.

Auth systems. Payment processing. REST APIs.
Code that passes review. Code that ships.

1,200+ developers trust ClaudeKit for production features.
Your turn."

Brand Alignment Check:
✓ Professional (no hype words like "revolutionary")
✓ Approachable (short sentences, conversational)
✓ Results-focused (specific time savings, outcomes)
✓ Peer-to-peer (developer language, shared pain)
✓ Honest claims (real numbers, real capabilities)
✓ Technical credibility (specific features, production-ready)
```

### 6. Multi-Channel Campaign Copy

Coordinate messaging across all touchpoints.

**Example:**
```
You: "Create launch campaign copy across all channels"

copywriter:

Campaign: AI Code Assistant Launch
Message Theme: "Stop writing. Start shipping."

Email Sequence:

Email 1 (Day 0): "The feature you'd build in 6 hours"
→ Problem: Time wasted on boilerplate
→ CTA: Watch 90-second demo

Email 2 (Day 2): "1,200 devs shipped features this week"
→ Social proof: Customer results
→ CTA: Start free trial

Email 3 (Day 4): "Your auth system is 6 minutes away"
→ Specific use case: Authentication
→ CTA: See the code

Email 4 (Day 7): "Why senior devs are using AI assistants"
→ Objection handling: "AI can't write production code"
→ CTA: Read case study

Social Media:

Twitter: Daily tips (code snippets, results)
LinkedIn: Weekly case studies (ROI, time savings)
Dev.to: Technical deep-dives (how it works)

Ad Copy:

Google Search Ad:
Headline: "Build Auth in 6 Minutes | ClaudeKit"
Description: "Production-ready authentication. Email, OAuth, 2FA. Ships today."

LinkedIn Ad:
"Senior devs use AI to skip boilerplate. You should too."
[Feature comparison graphic]

Landing Page Variants:

Variant A (Time Savings):
"Ship Features 10x Faster"
→ Target: Time-pressed eng teams

Variant B (Quality):
"Production Code, Zero Bugs"
→ Target: Quality-focused teams

Variant C (Hiring):
"Your Team of 3 Ships Like a Team of 10"
→ Target: Resource-constrained startups

Message Consistency:
✓ All channels emphasize speed + production quality
✓ Specific time savings (6 min, 10x)
✓ Real outcomes, not vague benefits
✓ Technical credibility throughout
```

   Expected Lift: +40-60% open rate (18-20%)

4. You approve test matrix

5. Copywriter coordinates with Email Wizard for sequence setup
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific, Not Vague

**Bad:** "Increase your productivity"
**Good:** "Ship features 10x faster - 6 minutes instead of 6 hours"

Specific numbers, outcomes, and timeframes build credibility.

### 2. Lead with Benefits, Not Features

**Bad:** "Built on Claude Opus 4.5 with multi-agent orchestration"
**Good:** "Your AI dev team ships in 6 minutes what takes you 6 hours"

Features are how it works. Benefits are why it matters.

### 3. Write for Humans, Not Algorithms

**Bad:** "Best AI-powered code generation tool for developers 2025"
**Good:** "Stop writing boilerplate. Start shipping features."

SEO-stuffed copy kills conversions. Write for readers first.
