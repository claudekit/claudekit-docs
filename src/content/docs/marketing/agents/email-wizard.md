# Email Wizard

> **Your nurture campaign architect** - Turn cold subscribers into warm leads with strategic email sequences

## What This Agent Does

Your email open rates are stuck at 18% when industry average is 25%. Your welcome sequence is a single email that gets ignored. You send the same generic message to everyone in your list. Your emails land in spam or get deleted without being read.

**The Problem**: Most email campaigns fail because they're one-size-fits-all blasts sent at random times with boring subject lines. They don't nurture relationships, segment audiences, or test what works. The result? Low engagement, high unsubscribes, and wasted list potential.

**The Solution**: The Email Wizard is your senior email marketing strategist who designs high-performing campaigns. This agent creates multi-email nurture sequences, implements dynamic personalization, optimizes send times by timezone and engagement patterns, designs A/B tests for continuous improvement, writes compelling subject lines that get opened, and architects sophisticated drip campaigns with branching logic.

This agent uses proven frameworks from top email marketers, combining behavioral triggers with psychological principles to create emails that get opened, read, and clicked.

## Quick Start

Create your first email sequence in 30 seconds:

```bash
# Generate a welcome sequence
/ask "Create a 5-email welcome sequence for new subscribers to [your product]"

# The agent designs the full sequence with subject lines, timing, and CTAs
```

## Capabilities

### Sequence Template Generation

Build proven email sequences for every stage of the customer journey. The agent designs welcome sequences that activate new subscribers, creates nurture campaigns that educate and build trust, builds abandoned cart flows that recover lost revenue, develops re-engagement series that wake up dormant contacts, and structures launch sequences for new products or features.

**Example**: A 7-day welcome sequence with Day 0 (immediate welcome), Day 1 (value delivery), Day 3 (social proof), Day 5 (problem-solution), Day 7 (CTA) perfectly timed to convert free users to paid.

### Dynamic Content Personalization

Make every email feel personally written. The agent implements merge tag strategies beyond first name, designs conditional content blocks that change based on behavior, creates segment-specific messaging by industry or role, develops behavior-triggered content (clicked but didn't buy? Here's why), and builds personalization frameworks that scale across your entire program.

### Send-Time Optimization

Get more opens by sending at the right time. The agent analyzes optimal send times by segment and industry, recommends timezone-based sending to reach people at local times, designs frequency strategies to maximize engagement without fatigue, plans campaign calendars to avoid overlap, and balances engagement goals with unsubscribe risk.

### A/B Test Design and Analysis

Continuously improve through systematic testing. The agent creates test hypotheses based on best practices, designs test variations for subject lines, content, CTAs, and timing, calculates required sample sizes for statistical significance, analyzes test results with clear recommendations, and recommends winning strategies to roll out.

### Subject Line Generation

Write subject lines that demand attention. The agent creates compelling subject lines using proven psychological triggers, crafts preview text strategies that extend the hook, tests different approaches (curiosity, urgency, benefit, question), optimizes for mobile display (first 30 characters), and avoids spam trigger words that hurt deliverability.

### Drip Campaign Architecture

Build sophisticated automation that nurtures at scale. The agent designs automation workflows with clear goals per email, creates branching logic based on opens, clicks, and actions, builds trigger conditions for entry and progression, plans exit criteria so people don't get stuck, and documents flow diagrams for your team to implement.

## When to Use

Use the Email Wizard when you need to:
- Create welcome sequences that convert new subscribers
- Build nurture campaigns that move leads through your funnel
- Design re-engagement campaigns for inactive contacts
- Optimize email performance with A/B testing
- Implement personalization and segmentation strategies
- Architect complex drip campaigns with automation

## Example Workflows

### Workflow 1: Welcome Sequence

Create a high-converting onboarding experience:

```bash
# Step 1: Define your goal
/ask "Create a welcome sequence that converts free trial users to paid within 7 days"

# The agent will design:
# - Email 0 (Immediate): Welcome + quick win setup
# - Email 1 (Day 1): Feature spotlight + use case
# - Email 2 (Day 3): Social proof + case study
# - Email 3 (Day 5): Problem-solution fit + benefits
# - Email 4 (Day 6): Urgency + upgrade CTA
# - Email 5 (Day 8): Last chance + offer

# Each email includes:
# - Subject line + preview text
# - Body content with personalization
# - CTA strategy
# - Optimal send time
```

**Output**: Complete sequence with copy, timing, and conversion optimization.

### Workflow 2: Nurture Campaign

Build trust over time:

```bash
# Create educational nurture series
/ask "Design a nurture campaign for leads who aren't ready to buy yet"

# The agent creates:
# - Value-first content (no selling)
# - Educational resources and tips
# - Case studies and social proof
# - Gradual product introduction
# - Soft CTAs (demos, consultations)

# With segmentation logic:
# - If clicks pricing → move to decision sequence
# - If high engagement → increase frequency
# - If low engagement → reduce frequency
```

**Output**: Nurture sequence with branching logic based on engagement.

### Workflow 3: A/B Test Strategy

Optimize your email performance:

```bash
# Design test plan
/ask "Create A/B test recommendations for our [campaign type]"

# The agent will:
# - Identify testable elements (subject, CTA, content, timing)
# - Create test hypotheses with expected outcomes
# - Design variations (A vs B vs C)
# - Calculate sample size needed
# - Recommend test duration
# - Define success metrics

# Prioritizes tests by expected impact
```

**Output**: Complete test plan with variations and success criteria.

### Workflow 4: Re-engagement Campaign

Win back inactive subscribers:

```bash
# Recover dormant contacts
/ask "Create a re-engagement campaign for contacts who haven't opened in 60 days"

# The agent designs:
# - Attention-grabbing subject lines
# - "We miss you" messaging
# - Value reminder (why they subscribed)
# - New content or offers
# - Preference center option
# - Unsubscribe path for non-responders
```

**Output**: Re-engagement sequence that recovers or cleans your list.

## Best Practices

1. **Mobile-First Design**: 60% of emails are opened on mobile. Write subject lines under 40 characters and keep content scannable with short paragraphs and clear CTAs.

2. **Test Everything**: Subject lines, send times, CTAs, content length—everything affects performance. The agent helps design systematic tests.

3. **Segment Relentlessly**: One message for everyone is a message for no one. Use behavioral and demographic data to send relevant content.

4. **Automate Based on Behavior**: Don't just send time-based sequences. Trigger emails based on actions (visited pricing, downloaded resource, abandoned cart).

5. **Clean Your List**: Regularly remove non-engagers. Better to have 1,000 engaged subscribers than 10,000 who ignore you. Re-engagement campaigns help identify who to remove.

6. **Write Like a Human**: Avoid corporate speak. Write conversational emails that feel personal, even at scale. The agent uses natural language and appropriate tone.

## MCP Integrations

The Email Wizard can integrate with email platforms when configured:

- **SendGrid MCP**: Send emails, check statistics, manage campaigns
- **Resend MCP**: Alternative for transactional email

When MCP unavailable, the agent generates templates for manual implementation.

## Skills Integration

The Email Wizard uses:

- **assets-organizing** - Standardized file output for email copy
- **creativity** - Visual design, color psychology, formatting decisions

Skills are activated automatically based on task requirements.

## Output Assets

The agent organizes email copy in standardized locations:

- **Email Sequences**: `assets/copy/emails/{date}-{sequence}-{slug}.md`
- **Individual Emails**: `assets/copy/emails/{date}-{campaign}-email-{N}.md`
- **Reports**: `campaigns/email/email-wizard-{date}-{campaign-slug}.md`
