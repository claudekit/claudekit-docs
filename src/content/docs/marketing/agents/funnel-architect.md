# Funnel Architect

> **Your conversion engineer** - Design high-performing funnels that turn traffic into revenue

## What This Agent Does

Your funnel conversion rate is stuck at 2% when top performers hit 15%. You're getting traffic but people drop off before buying. You don't know which stage is broken. You've tried random tweaks but nothing moves the needle. Revenue is leaving your funnel through invisible leaks.

**The Problem**: Most funnels fail because they're built on guesswork instead of proven frameworks. Companies optimize the wrong stages, miss critical bottlenecks, create friction at decision points, and leave money on the table because they can't see where the problems are.

**The Solution**: The Funnel Architect is your senior conversion strategist who designs and optimizes entire customer journeys. This agent maps every funnel stage from awareness to purchase, analyzes conversion rates at each step, identifies bottlenecks causing the biggest drops, designs A/B tests with maximum impact, applies the Hormozi value equation to offer design, and implements attribution modeling to optimize channel mix.

This agent uses complex reasoning (Opus model) to understand multi-stage funnels and applies proven frameworks from top direct-response marketers to maximize conversion at every stage.

## Quick Start

Audit your funnel in 30 seconds:

```bash
# Analyze your current funnel
/ask "Audit our [product] funnel and identify bottlenecks"

# The agent maps stages, identifies drops, and recommends fixes
```

## Capabilities

### Funnel Stage Design

Build funnels that guide prospects smoothly to purchase. The agent designs awareness-stage content that attracts the right audience, creates consideration touchpoints that educate and build trust, builds decision-stage offers that overcome objections, plans post-purchase sequences that maximize LTV, and structures upsell flows that feel natural.

**Example**: A webinar funnel with registration page (50% opt-in), confirmation sequence (80% attendance), webinar presentation (45% to offer), checkout page (12% purchase), and upsell sequence (30% take offer) = 2.7% end-to-end conversion.

### Conversion Rate Analysis

Diagnose exactly where your funnel is broken. The agent diagnoses conversion bottlenecks at each stage, analyzes drop-off patterns and identifies causes, finds friction points in user experience, compares your rates to industry benchmarks, and tracks micro-conversions that lead to macro conversions.

### Bottleneck Identification

Find and fix your biggest leaks first. The agent maps complete conversion paths from first touch to purchase, finds leak points where you lose the most people, diagnoses user friction causing abandonment, identifies missing elements (trust signals, information, offers), and prioritizes fixes by potential impact on revenue.

### A/B Test Recommendations

Systematically improve through testing. The agent designs test hypotheses based on conversion principles, prioritizes test opportunities by expected impact and effort, calculates test duration for statistical significance, recommends specific variations to test, and analyzes results with clear winning recommendations.

### Offer Sequencing (Hormozi Model)

Apply the Hormozi value equation to your offers. The agent designs value stacking (combining multiple elements), creates bonus structures that increase perceived value, builds urgency and scarcity tactics ethically, applies price anchoring strategies, and designs risk reversal offers (guarantees, trials).

The value equation: Value = (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood) / (Time Delay × Effort and Sacrifice). The agent optimizes all four variables.

### Attribution Modeling

Understand what's actually driving conversions. The agent defines appropriate attribution windows, compares attribution models (first-touch, last-touch, linear, time-decay, position-based), tracks multi-touch conversion paths, measures true channel contribution, and optimizes channel mix for maximum ROI.

## When to Use

Use the Funnel Architect when you need to:
- Design a new funnel from scratch for a product or campaign
- Diagnose why your current funnel has low conversion
- Identify the biggest bottlenecks killing revenue
- Optimize offer design using proven frameworks
- Design A/B testing roadmaps for systematic improvement
- Understand multi-channel attribution

## Example Workflows

### Workflow 1: Complete Funnel Audit

Diagnose and fix your funnel:

```bash
# Step 1: Map your current funnel
/ask "Map our current funnel for [product] and calculate stage-by-stage conversion"

# Agent will request or analyze:
# - Traffic sources and volume
# - Landing page conversion
# - Lead magnet/signup rate
# - Email engagement
# - Sales page visit rate
# - Purchase conversion
# - Upsell take rate

# Step 2: Identify bottlenecks
# Agent calculates drops and identifies largest leaks

# Step 3: Get prioritized recommendations
# Agent suggests fixes ranked by impact:
# - Critical: 50% of people abandon cart (payment friction?)
# - High: 70% don't open welcome email (subject line?)
# - Medium: 25% bounce from landing page (clarity issue?)
```

**Output**: Complete funnel audit with bottlenecks ranked and fixes prioritized.

### Workflow 2: Funnel Design from Scratch

Build a high-converting funnel:

```bash
# Design new funnel
/ask "Design a [funnel type] for [product] targeting [audience]"

# Common funnel types:
# - Webinar funnel (registration → attendance → offer → purchase)
# - Lead magnet funnel (opt-in → nurture → sales offer)
# - Free trial funnel (signup → activation → upgrade)
# - Product launch funnel (interest → waitlist → launch → purchase)

# Agent will create:
# - Stage-by-stage flow diagram
# - Expected conversion rates per stage
# - Content/offers needed for each stage
# - Estimated ROI model
# - Implementation timeline
```

**Output**: Complete funnel blueprint ready to build.

### Workflow 3: Offer Optimization (Hormozi Model)

Apply value equation to your offer:

```bash
# Optimize your offer
/ask "Apply the Hormozi value equation to optimize our [product] offer"

# Agent analyzes all four variables:
# 1. Dream Outcome → What's the ideal result? Make it bigger.
# 2. Perceived Likelihood → Will they believe they'll achieve it? Add proof.
# 3. Time Delay → How long to see results? Reduce perceived time.
# 4. Effort/Sacrifice → How hard is it? Reduce friction and complexity.

# Agent will recommend:
# - Value stack structure (core + bonuses)
# - Guarantee design (risk reversal)
# - Urgency mechanism (genuine scarcity)
# - Price anchoring strategy
# - Offer presentation order
```

**Output**: Optimized offer structure with value stack and positioning.

### Workflow 4: A/B Test Roadmap

Systematic improvement plan:

```bash
# Create test plan
/ask "Create an A/B testing roadmap for our [product] funnel"

# Agent will:
# - Identify highest-impact test opportunities
# - Design specific test hypotheses
# - Create variations (control vs. variant)
# - Calculate sample size needed
# - Estimate test duration
# - Define success metrics
# - Prioritize by expected impact

# Example tests:
# 1. Landing page headline (high impact, easy)
# 2. Pricing page layout (high impact, medium)
# 3. Checkout button copy (medium impact, easy)
```

**Output**: 6-12 month testing roadmap with prioritized experiments.

## Best Practices

1. **Fix Biggest Leaks First**: Don't optimize a 98% converting step. Find the stage where you lose the most people (in absolute numbers, not percentages) and fix that first.

2. **Reduce Friction Everywhere**: Every form field, every page load, every decision point is friction. Remove anything non-essential. The agent identifies friction points.

3. **Add Social Proof Liberally**: Testimonials, reviews, customer counts, case studies—proof reduces risk at every stage. The agent suggests where to add proof.

4. **Make Offers Irresistible**: Use value stacking, bonuses, guarantees, and urgency. The Hormozi model works because it makes saying no harder than saying yes.

5. **Test Aggressively**: The difference between 2% and 5% conversion is 150% more revenue. Systematic testing compounds into massive gains. Follow the agent's test roadmap.

6. **Track Everything**: You can't optimize what you don't measure. Implement proper tracking at every funnel stage before trying to improve it.

## MCP Integrations

The Funnel Architect can integrate with analytics platforms:

- **Google Analytics MCP**: Funnel visualization, conversion paths, drop-off analysis

When MCP unavailable, the agent uses manual analysis based on provided data.

## Output Assets

The agent organizes funnel assets in standardized locations:

- **Funnel Designs**: `assets/funnels/designs/{date}-{slug}-funnel.md`
