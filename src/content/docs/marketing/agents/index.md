## How to Use Agents

### Direct Invocation

Call agents explicitly when you need their expertise:

```bash
# Campaign orchestration
/campaign create "Q1 Product Launch"

# Content creation (use copywriting skill - quality mode)
"Create comparison landing page"

# SEO optimization
/seo optimize "product page"
```

### Automatic Delegation

ClaudeKit routes tasks to appropriate agents automatically:

```
You: "I need to improve our email open rates"
→ email-wizard agent handles analysis and recommendations

You: "Audit our website for SEO issues"
→ seo-specialist agent performs comprehensive audit

You: "Create a launch campaign across all channels"
→ campaign-manager agent orchestrates the plan
```

### Multi-Agent Workflows

Complex tasks automatically involve multiple agents:

```bash
/campaign create "Product Launch"
```

**Behind the scenes:**
1. `campaign-manager` creates overall strategy
2. `copywriter` writes messaging
3. `content-creator` produces assets
4. `email-wizard` builds nurture sequences
5. `social-media-manager` plans social calendar
6. `analytics-analyst` defines success metrics

## Quick Start Examples

### Launch a Campaign

```
You: "Plan a product launch campaign for our new AI feature"

campaign-manager: I'll create a multi-channel launch plan...

✓ Campaign Strategy (4 channels, 6 weeks)
✓ Content Calendar (42 pieces)
✓ Budget Allocation ($10K across channels)
✓ Success Metrics (Awareness, Leads, Conversions)
```

### Create High-Converting Copy

```
You: "Write hero copy for our landing page"

copywriter: I'll craft conversion-focused headlines...

Primary Version:
"Stop Writing Code. Start Shipping Features."

Alternatives:
1. "Your AI Dev Team Ships in 6 Minutes, Not 6 Hours"
2. "Skip the Boilerplate. Claude Builds It For You."

Rationale: Focus on speed, outcomes, pain relief.
```

### Optimize Your Funnel

```
You: "Our signup funnel converts at only 1.2%"
