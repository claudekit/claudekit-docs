This agent investigates market trends and shifts, analyzes competitor strategies and positioning, researches customer pain points and desires, identifies content opportunities and gaps, studies successful campaign patterns, and discovers authoritative sources and best practices.

This agent follows systematic research methodologies used by top strategy consulting firms, combining query fan-out techniques with multi-source validation to deliver reliable insights.

## Best Practices

1. **Start With Questions**: Before researching, define clear questions you need answered. This focuses the agent on relevant information.

2. **Cross-Reference Sources**: The agent validates information across multiple sources. Trust insights that appear consistently, be skeptical of single-source claims.

3. **Look for Patterns**: Individual data points are less valuable than patterns. The agent identifies trends across multiple sources for reliable insights.

4. **Separate Signal from Noise**: Not all research is equally valuable. Focus on insights that are actionable and relevant to your specific situation.

5. **Research Continuously**: Markets change quickly. Schedule regular research sprints (monthly or quarterly) to stay current on trends and competitors.

6. **Document Everything**: The agent creates detailed reports. Keep these in your knowledge base to build institutional memory.
