# Social Media Manager

> Your strategic social media director who builds engaged audiences and drives business results across all platforms.

## What This Agent Does

**The Problem**: You're posting content. Maybe consistently, maybe sporadically. But engagement is flat. Follower growth is stagnant. You can't tell which posts work and which don't. You're spending hours creating content that gets 12 likes and disappears.

Social media feels like shouting into the void. You know it should drive business results, but you're stuck in the content hamster wheel without a clear strategy.

**The Solution**: Social Media Manager is your senior strategist who creates platform-specific content calendars, analyzes engagement patterns, optimizes posting strategy, researches trends, and coordinates multi-platform campaigns. Think of it as having a social media director who actually understands what drives results.

No more random posting. No more guessing what works. Just data-driven social strategy that builds audience and drives business outcomes.

## Quick Start

30-second example - create content calendar:

```
You: "Create a week of social content for our AI code tool"

"We shipped our MVP in 3 days instead of 3 weeks."

That's what Sarah Chen, founder of DataFlow, told us after using ClaudeKit.

Here's what her AI dev team built in 72 hours:
→ Full authentication system
→ Stripe payment integration
→ REST API with validation
→ Admin dashboard

4 features that would normally take her team 2-3 weeks.

The best part? She didn't sacrifice quality. Every line of code passed review. All tests green. Zero security issues.

```
3 signs you're wasting dev time on boilerplate:

1. You've copied auth code from Stack Overflow more than once this month
2. Your team argues about which payment gateway to use (for the 5th time)
3. Junior devs spend days on features senior devs could build in hours

There's a better way 🧵
```

Tweet 2:
```
Most dev teams spend 60% of time on features that exist in every SaaS product:
- User auth
- Payments
- Email notifications
- Admin panels

That's not differentiation. That's overhead.
```

```
Your AI dev team can build these in minutes:

ClaudeKit ships production-ready code for:
→ Authentication: 6 min
→ Stripe integration: 8 min
→ REST API: 5 min
→ Email system: 7 min

You focus on what makes your product unique.

[POST TITLE: The End of Boilerplate Development]

I've been writing code for 15 years.

In that time, I've built authentication systems 34 times. Payment integrations 28 times. REST APIs? Lost count.

Every startup, every side project, every new job - same code, slightly different requirements.

We joke about "reinventing the wheel" but that's exactly what we do. Daily.

Here's what changed: AI can now write this code for us.

Not snippets. Not suggestions. Complete, production-ready features.

I tested this last week. My AI teammate built a full auth system in 6 minutes:
- Email & OAuth login
- Password reset flow
- 2FA with SMS
- Session management
- Unit tests (94% coverage)

The code? Cleaner than I would have written.

This isn't about replacing developers. It's about freeing us to build what actually matters.

The authentication system isn't your competitive advantage. Your unique features are.

Let AI handle the boilerplate. You handle the innovation.

What do you think - is this the future of development?

"But can AI really write production-quality code?"

I was skeptical too.

Here's what I learned after shipping 12 AI-generated features to production:

Q: Is it secure?
A: More than my code. AI follows OWASP guidelines consistently. I don't always remember to.

Q: Does it have tests?
A: Every feature ships with 90%+ test coverage. Mine? Maybe 60% on a good day.

Q: What about edge cases?
A: AI considers cases I'd miss. It's read millions of codebases.

Q: Can I customize it?
A: It's your code. Edit anything. No black box.

Q: What if it makes mistakes?
A: It does. Rarely. But so do I. Code review catches both.

The real question: Why waste your time writing code that's been written a million times before?

Let AI handle the boilerplate. You build what makes your product unique.

I built my startup's MVP in 3 days.

Not because I'm a 10x engineer.

Because I stopped writing boilerplate.

Day 1: Auth system (6 min) + Stripe (8 min)
Day 2: REST API (5 min) + Email (7 min)
Day 3: Admin dashboard + actual unique features

Total: 26 minutes of boilerplate, 3 days of innovation.

That's the power of AI dev tools.

## Capabilities

### 1. Multi-Platform Content Creation

Adapt messaging for each platform's algorithm and audience.

**Platform-Specific Best Practices:**

**Twitter/X:**
- First 140 characters are critical (preview text)
- Short, punchy sentences
- No hashtags (hurt reach)
- Threads for storytelling
- Engagement bait: Questions, hot takes, lists

**LinkedIn:**
- First 2 lines must hook (before "see more")
- Professional but not corporate
- Data and stories over fluff
- Best times: Weekday mornings (9-11 AM EST)
- Use personal voice, not brand

**Instagram:**
- Visual-first content
- Stories for behind-the-scenes
- Reels for reach (algorithm favors video)
- Carousel posts for educational content
- Hashtags still work (use 5-10 relevant)

**TikTok:**
- First 3 seconds decide watch time
- Trending audio boosts reach
- Hook → Value → CTA format
- Caption: Short, direct
- Post 1-3x per day for algorithm

**Facebook:**
- Community focus over brand
- Longer posts perform well
- Questions drive comments
- Groups > Pages for engagement
- Video gets 5x reach vs text

### 2. Content Calendar Management

Plan themes, coordinate campaigns, maintain consistency.

**Example - Monthly Theme Calendar:**
```
JANUARY THEME: "Ship 10x Faster"
Goal: 200 trial signups
Strategy: Showcase speed + quality

Week 1: Problem awareness (slow dev cycles)
Week 2: Solution education (how AI helps)
Week 3: Social proof (customer stories)
Week 4: Conversion push (limited-time offer)

Week 1 Content Mix:
→ 40% Problem posts ("You've written auth 47 times...")
→ 30% Educational ("3 signs you're wasting dev time...")
→ 20% Social proof ("1,200 devs shipped yesterday...")
→ 10% Direct CTA ("Try it free...")

Platform priorities:
→ Twitter/X: Daily (high volume, high reach)
→ LinkedIn: 3x/week (professional audience)
→ Dev.to: 1x/week (technical deep-dive)
→ Instagram: 2x/week (visual content)

Content types:
→ 50% Original posts
→ 30% Curated/reshared content
→ 20% User-generated content

Coordination with campaigns:
→ Email campaign launches Tuesday (align social)

## Best Practices

### 1. Platform-Native Content

**Bad:** Same post on all platforms
**Good:** Adapt content for each platform's audience and format

Twitter threads ≠ LinkedIn posts ≠ TikTok videos

### 2. Consistency Over Volume

**Bad:** Post 5x one week, 0x next week
**Good:** Post 2-3x per week, every week

Algorithms reward consistency.

### 3. Engage, Don't Just Broadcast

**Bad:** Post and disappear
**Good:** Post, then spend 2 hours responding/engaging

Social media is social. Conversations build audience.
