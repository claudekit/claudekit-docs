# UI/UX Designer Agent

> **Your design specialist** - Crafts interfaces that delight users and drive conversions

## What This Agent Does

Your campaign landing page looks okay. It's functional. But it doesn't convert like competitor pages. Users bounce quickly. The design feels generic, not compelling. You know design matters, but you're not a designer.

**The Problem**: Good design is hard. Creating interfaces that are beautiful, accessible, high-converting, and on-brand requires expertise most developers don't have. Generic templates don't differentiate you. Poor UX costs conversions and revenue.

**The Solution**: The UI/UX Designer Agent creates award-winning interfaces with professional design quality. It researches trending designs, applies proven UX patterns, ensures accessibility, optimizes for conversions, and maintains your brand identity. You get designs that look like you hired a top agency.

```bash
# Create a landing page design
/design "Create landing page for SaaS product with hero, features, pricing"
```

## Tips

**Research First**: Top designers research before designing. Study award-winning examples, analyze what works, then create.

**Mobile-First Always**: Design for mobile first, then scale up. It's easier than designing desktop and cramming into mobile.

**Test Accessibility**: Use automated tools (axe DevTools, WAVE) and manual testing (keyboard navigation, screen readers).

**Optimize Images**: Use WebP with PNG fallback. Compress with TinyPNG. Lazy load below-fold images. Every KB counts.

**Measure Results**: Great design drives results. Use analytics to measure conversion impact. A/B test variations.

**Maintain Design System**: Update `docs/design-guidelines.md` with every new pattern. Consistency compounds over time.
