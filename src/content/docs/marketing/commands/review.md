> Quality assurance before you commit

## Quick Start

```bash
/ckm:review
```

**What happens**:
1. code-reviewer agent analyzes recent changes
2. Checks security vulnerabilities
3. Evaluates performance
4. Validates architecture patterns
5. Verifies YAGNI/KISS/DRY principles

**Output**: Review report with severity-ranked issues

## Syntax

```bash
/ckm:review [files or scope]
```

## Example Output

```markdown
✓ code-reviewer: Analyzing changes...

Files reviewed: 8
Lines changed: +247, -89
