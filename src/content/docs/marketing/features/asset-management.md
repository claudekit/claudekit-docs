## Integration with Commands

The Content Hub integrates seamlessly with marketing commands:

# Uses writing styles from /assets/writing-styles/
/write:blog --style "casual-founder-voice"
```

See [Write Commands](/docs/marketing/commands/write) for details.

### `/video` Commands

```bash
# Storyboards saved to /assets/storyboards/
/video:storyboard "Product demo for homepage"

# Complete video workflow uses storyboard assets
/video:create --storyboard "/assets/storyboards/product-demo.md"
```

See [Video Commands](/docs/marketing/commands/video) for details.

```bash
# Presentations saved to /assets/slides/
/slide:create "Q4 Campaign Proposal"

# Output: /assets/slides/q4-campaign-proposal.pptx
```

See [Slide Commands](/docs/marketing/commands/slide) for details.

### `/dashboard` Command

```bash
# Open Content Hub in browser
/dashboard

# Open specific category
/dashboard --category storyboards

# Open with search query
/dashboard --search "pricing strategy"
```

See [Dashboard Command](/docs/marketing/commands/dashboard) for details.

## Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Campaign Asset Creation

```bash
# 1. Generate campaign storyboard
/video:storyboard "SaaS product launch - 60s YouTube ad"

# 2. Create presentation for stakeholder approval
/slide:create "Product Launch Campaign Proposal"

# 3. Write blog post to accompany launch
/write:blog "Introducing Our Revolutionary SaaS Platform"

# 4. Review all assets in Content Hub
/dashboard --category recent
```

All assets auto-organized in `/assets/` with proper categorization.

### Example 2: Brand Consistency Check

```bash
# 1. Open branding guidelines
/dashboard --category branding

# 2. Review brand voice and color palette
# 3. Audit existing copy against guidelines
/write:audit /assets/copy/blog-posts/recent-post.md

# 4. Update copy to match brand voice
# 5. Verify consistency in Content Hub preview
```

### Example 3: Content Repurposing

```bash
# 1. Find existing blog post in Content Hub
/dashboard --search "pricing strategies"

# 2. Repurpose into slide deck
/slide:create "Pricing Strategies Webinar" --source /assets/copy/blog-posts/pricing-guide.md

# 3. Create video storyboard from slides
/video:storyboard --based-on /assets/slides/pricing-webinar.pptx

# 4. Generate social posts from key points
/social:post --platform linkedin --source /assets/slides/pricing-webinar.pptx
```

## Unfair Advantage

Content Hub leverages ClaudeKit's **codebase context** for product-aware asset generation:

- **Product Screenshots** - Automatically extracted from your codebase
- **Feature Descriptions** - Generated from actual code and docs
- **Technical Accuracy** - Marketing claims verified against implementation
- **Version Sync** - Assets updated when product features change

Example:

```bash
# Generate storyboard with actual product screenshots
/video:storyboard "Feature demo: AI-powered analytics dashboard"

# ClaudeKit:
# 1. Scans /src/components/Analytics/ for actual UI
# 2. Captures live screenshots of dashboard
# 3. Generates storyboard with real product visuals
# 4. Ensures feature descriptions match implementation
```

See [Marketing Index](/docs/marketing/) for more on codebase-context advantages.

## Best Practices

**1. Naming Conventions**:
- Use kebab-case for filenames: `product-launch-video.md`
- Include dates for versioned content: `pitch-deck-2025-01.pptx`
- Prefix drafts: `draft-campaign-proposal.md`

**2. Organization**:
- Group related assets in subdirectories
- Use consistent category structure
- Tag assets for cross-category discoverability

**3. Version Control**:
- Initialize Git in `/assets/` directory
- Commit after major asset creation
- Use descriptive commit messages

**4. Metadata**:
- Add frontmatter to markdown assets
- Include creation date, author, status
- Tag with relevant keywords

**5. Cleanup**:
- Archive outdated campaigns
- Delete unused drafts regularly
- Export completed campaigns for backup

## Technical Details

**Supported File Types**:
- **Text**: `.md`, `.txt`, `.html`
- **Images**: `.png`, `.jpg`, `.svg`, `.webp`
- **Videos**: `.mp4`, `.webm`, `.mov`
- **Documents**: `.pdf`, `.pptx`, `.docx`
- **Data**: `.json`, `.csv`, `.yaml`

**Performance**:
- Lazy loading for large asset libraries
- Thumbnail caching for images/videos
- Indexed search for instant results

**Security**:
- Local-only storage (no cloud sync)
- Git-based versioning (optional)
- No external dependencies
