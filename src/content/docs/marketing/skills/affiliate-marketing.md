## Prerequisites

- Product/service with proven conversion funnel
- Customer LTV data to calculate commissions
- Affiliate agreement template (legal review recommended)

## Configuration

**Program design checklist**:
- [ ] Commission structure defined
- [ ] Cookie window set (60-120 days typical for SaaS)
- [ ] Payment terms established (Net 30/60/90)
- [ ] Fraud prevention rules configured
- [ ] Affiliate onboarding kit ready
- [ ] Tracking and attribution setup verified

## Best Practices

**1. Two-Sided Rewards Work Best**
Both referrer AND referee receive incentives. Increases participation 68%.

**2. 90-Day Cookies For B2B SaaS**
B2B sales cycles are longer. Short cookies lose conversions due to long consideration windows.

**3. Commission Holds Prevent Fraud**
Hold payments 60-90 days to match refund windows. Prevents fraudulent signups.

## Common Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Launch SaaS Affiliate Program
**Scenario**: Early-stage SaaS wants partner channel to complement paid ads.

**Workflow**:
1. Calculate max affordable commission (30% of MRR typical)
2. Choose platform (FirstPromoter recommended for <$500k ARR)
3. Create affiliate onboarding kit (brand assets, messaging guide, demo videos)
4. Recruit 10-20 initial affiliates (existing customers, micro-influencers)
5. Launch with 90-day cookie, Net 60 payment
6. Monitor EPC (Earnings Per Click) - target $5-50 for SaaS

**Success Metrics**: 5-9% participation rate, 5-10% referral rate.

### Use Case 2: Scale Existing Program
**Scenario**: Program has 50 affiliates, want to increase quality and reduce fraud.

**Workflow**:
1. Analyze affiliate performance (top 20% generates 80% of revenue)
2. Implement tiered commissions (base 20%, 30% at 10+ referrals, 40% at 50+)
3. Add vetting process for new affiliates (application review)
4. Deploy fraud detection (90-day holds, manual review of bulk signups)
5. Create retention program (monthly check-ins, content support for top 10%)

**Outcome**: Improved EPC, reduced fraud, higher affiliate retention.

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Low affiliate participation (<3%)
**Solution**: Increase commission to 25-30% OR improve affiliate resources (better content kit, landing pages).

**Issue**: High fraud rate
**Solution**: Implement 90-day hold periods, require affiliate vetting, add terms of service banning brand bidding and incentivized traffic.

**Issue**: Affiliates inactive after onboarding
**Solution**: Monthly check-ins, provide pre-made content, feature top performers to motivate others.
