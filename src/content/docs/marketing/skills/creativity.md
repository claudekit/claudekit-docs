2. Platform specs: 9:16 vertical, 15-30 seconds
3. Color palette: Brand colors + trending (check TikTok Creative Center)
4. Voice-over: Conversational, acceptable Gen Z slang

**Workflow**:
1. Review current brand (what works, what's outdated)
2. Research trends: `references/visual-trends.md` (2025-2026 trends)
3. Select 2-3 compatible styles (e.g., Minimalist Clean + Bold Typography + Gradient accents)
4. Define color evolution (keep primary colors, update secondaries)
5. Create mood board with style references
6. Document in brand guidelines update

**Output**: Visual direction document with before/after comparisons and rollout roadmap.

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Creative feels generic, undifferentiated
**Solution**: Layer 2-3 styles (e.g., Minimalist + Neon accents + Hand-drawn elements). Unique combinations create memorable brands.

**Issue**: Low engagement despite following best practices
**Solution**: Test creative variations (3-5). What works for others may not work for your audience. A/B test continuously.

**Issue**: Creative doesn't align with brand guidelines
**Solution**: Use brand-guidelines skill to extract brand context. Include in creative brief to ensure alignment.
