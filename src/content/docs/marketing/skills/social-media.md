## Capabilities

### 1. Platform Optimization
Content templates adapted to each platform's format and audience.

**Platform Specs**:
| Platform | Post Length | Best Times | Engagement Type |
|----------|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| LinkedIn | 3000 chars | Tue-Thu 8-10am | Professional, value-driven |
| Twitter/X | 280 chars | Tue-Fri 9am-12pm | Concise, conversational |
| Instagram | 2200 chars | Mon-Fri 11am-2pm | Visual-first, storytelling |
| TikTok | 4000 chars | Tue-Thu 7-9pm | Entertaining, trending |

### 2. Thread Creation Templates
Proven structures for educational, storytelling, and list-format threads.

**Thread Types**:
- **Educational**: "How to X in 7 steps" (with visuals)
- **Story**: Personal journey or customer success stories
- **List**: "10 tools I use daily" with one-line descriptions
- **How-to**: Step-by-step guide with examples
- **Analysis**: Deep-dive on topic breakdown

**Hook Formula**: Problem + Promise in tweet 1 (most important)

**Template Library**: `references/thread-templates.md`

### 3. Cross-Posting Adaptation
Convert core content to platform-specific formats while maintaining message.

**Adaptation Workflow**:
1. Create primary content (e.g., LinkedIn post)
2. Adapt voice by platform (professional → casual → visual)
3. Adjust format/length (3000 chars → 280 chars → caption)
4. Customize hashtags (3-5 LinkedIn, 20+ Instagram, 1-2 Twitter)
5. Stagger posting time (avoid simultaneous posts)

**Best Practices Guide**: `references/posting-best-practices.md`

## Prerequisites

- Brand guidelines for social media voice
- Platform accounts with posting permissions
- Content calendar or scheduling tool

## Configuration

No configuration needed. Skill provides templates adaptable to your brand voice.

**Optional**: Configure platform APIs for automated posting (requires platform developer accounts).

## Best Practices

**1. Native Content Beats Cross-Posts**
Platform-specific content receives 2-3x engagement vs generic cross-posts.

**2. Engage Before and After Posting**
Spend 10 minutes engaging with others' content before posting yours. Algorithms reward active accounts.

**3. Use Platform Native Features**
LinkedIn carousels, Twitter polls, Instagram Reels, TikTok effects—algorithms prioritize native features.

## Common Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Product Launch Social Campaign
**Scenario**: Launch new feature across LinkedIn, Twitter, and Instagram.

**Workflow**:
1. LinkedIn: Professional post with business value + demo video
2. Twitter: Thread breaking down 3 key benefits + GIF
3. Instagram: Carousel with before/after screenshots + story caption

**Timing**: Stagger posts 2-4 hours for maximum reach.

**Output**: Platform-specific content bundle with optimized posting schedule.

### Use Case 2: Educational Thread Series
**Scenario**: Create weekly Twitter thread teaching marketing concepts.

**Workflow**:
1. Choose thread type (how-to, analysis, list)
2. Write hook tweet (problem + promise)
3. Outline 7-12 main points
4. Add visual support (screenshots, diagrams)
5. End with CTA (follow, reply, bookmark)

**Success Metrics**: 100+ likes, 20+ retweets, 5+ replies per thread.

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Low engagement despite consistent posting
**Solution**:
- Check posting times (use analytics to find when audience is active)
- Review hook strength (first line must grab attention)
- Increase engagement with others' content (10:1 ratio: engage 10x before posting 1x)

**Issue**: Content feels repetitive across platforms
**Solution**: Use cross-posting adaptation workflow. Same message, different voice/format per platform.

**Issue**: Running out of content ideas
**Solution**:
- Repurpose blog posts into threads/carousels
- Share customer wins and testimonials
- Document your process (behind-the-scenes content performs well)
