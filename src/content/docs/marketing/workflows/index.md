## Tips for Success

**Start Simple**
Begin with one workflow, master it, then add more. Don't try to implement all workflows at once.

**Customize to Your Needs**
Workflows are templates. Adapt steps, skip irrelevant sections, and add your own variations.

**Document Your Changes**
Keep notes on what works for your specific situation. Build your own playbook over time.

**Use Checkpoints**
Never skip verification steps. Catching issues early saves massive time later.

**Measure Everything**
Use Analytics Workflow to track results from all other workflows. Data drives improvement.
