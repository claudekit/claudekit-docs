# Integrating Payment Processing

Learn how to integrate payment processing with ClaudeKit - from one-time payments to subscriptions, webhooks, and revenue optimization.

## Overview

**Goal**: Implement secure payment processing with provider integration
**Time**: 25-50 minutes (vs 5-10 hours manually)
**Agents Used**: planner, researcher, tester, code-reviewer
**Commands**: /integrate:polar, /integrate:sepay, /cook, /test

## Prerequisites

- Existing application with user accounts
- Payment provider account (Stripe, Polar, etc.)
- SSL certificate (required for payments)
- Business/tax information configured

## Payment Providers

| Provider | Best For | Features | Setup Time |
|----------|----------|----------|------------|
| Stripe | Global, feature-rich | Cards, wallets, subscriptions | 20-30 min |
| Polar | Creator economy | Subscriptions, products | 15-25 min |
| PayPal | Global recognition | Cards, PayPal balance | 20-30 min |
| SePay | Vietnam market | Bank transfer, e-wallets | 15-20 min |
| Square | In-person + online | POS integration | 25-35 min |

### Step 3: Implement One-Time Payments

```bash
# Already done in Step 2, but can add specific features
/cook [add invoice generation for one-time payments]
```

**Payment flow**:
```javascript
// Frontend
const handlePayment = async (amount, currency) => {
  // 1. Create payment intent
  const { clientSecret } = await fetch('/api/payments/create-intent', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ amount, currency })
  }).then(r => r.json());

  // 2. Confirm with Stripe Elements
  const { error, paymentIntent } = await stripe.confirmCardPayment(
    clientSecret,
    { payment_method: { card: cardElement } }
  );

  // 3. Handle result
  if (error) {
    showError(error.message);
  } else if (paymentIntent.status === 'succeeded') {
    showSuccess('Payment successful!');
  }
};
```

## Payment Patterns

### Pattern 1: Freemium Model

```bash
/cook [implement freemium model with upgrade prompts]
```

### Pattern 2: Pay-What-You-Want

```bash
/cook [add pay-what-you-want pricing with suggested amounts]
```

### Pattern 3: Tiered Pricing

```bash
/cook [implement dynamic tiered pricing based on usage]
```

### Pattern 4: Marketplace Payments

```bash
/cook [implement marketplace payments with split payouts using Stripe Connect]
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Idempotency

```javascript
// Ensure operations are idempotent
const createPayment = async (idempotencyKey, data) => {
  return stripe.paymentIntents.create(data, {
    idempotencyKey
  });
};
```

### 2. Webhook Retry Logic

```javascript
// Handle webhook retries gracefully
const processWebhook = async (event) => {
  // Check if already processed
  const existing = await Webhook.findOne({
    eventId: event.id
  });

  if (existing) {
    return { status: 'already_processed' };
  }

  // Process and save
  await processEvent(event);
  await Webhook.create({ eventId: event.id });
};
```

### 3. Failed Payment Handling

```bash
/cook [implement dunning management with smart retry and email notifications]
```

### 4. PCI Compliance

```
✓ Never store card details
✓ Use Stripe Elements (PCI-compliant)
✓ Tokenize payment info
✓ HTTPS everywhere
✓ Regular security audits
```

### 5. Transaction Monitoring

```bash
/cook [add fraud detection and transaction monitoring]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Webhook Not Receiving Events

**Solution**:
```bash
# Test webhook locally with Stripe CLI
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe

# Or fix with ClaudeKit
/fix:fast [Stripe webhooks not being received]
```

### Issue: Payment Failing

**Solution**:
```bash
/fix:logs [analyze payment failure logs and fix issues]
```

### Issue: Double Charging

**Solution**:
```bash
/fix:fast [prevent double charging with idempotency keys]
```

### Issue: Tax Calculation Wrong

**Solution**:
```bash
/fix:fast [tax calculation incorrect for Canadian customers]
```
