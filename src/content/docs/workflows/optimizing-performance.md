# Optimizing Performance

Learn how to identify and fix performance bottlenecks with ClaudeKit - from profiling and analysis to implementation of caching, database optimization, and code improvements.

## Overview

**Goal**: Identify and resolve performance bottlenecks systematically
**Time**: 30-60 minutes (vs 4-12 hours manually)
**Agents Used**: debugger, code-reviewer, tester
**Commands**: /ck:debug, /ck:cook, /ck:test, /ck:fix

## Prerequisites

- Application with performance issues
- Monitoring/profiling tools installed
- Performance baseline metrics
- Test data representative of production

## Performance Targets

| Metric | Good | Acceptable | Poor |
|--------|------|------------|------|
| API Response Time | <200ms | 200-500ms | >500ms |
| Page Load Time | <2s | 2-4s | >4s |
| Database Query | <50ms | 50-200ms | >200ms |
| Memory Usage | <512MB | 512MB-2GB | >2GB |
| CPU Usage | <30% | 30-70% | >70% |

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Performance Issues

Start by profiling your application:

```bash
# Run performance analysis
/ck:debug [analyze application performance and identify bottlenecks]
```

### Step 2: Fix Database Performance

#### N+1 Query Problem

```bash
/ck:cook [fix N+1 query problem in user service with eager loading]
```

**Implementation**:
```
[1/4] Analyzing queries...
  ✓ Identified 156 individual queries
  ✓ Should be 1 query with joins

Before:
const users = await User.findAll();
for (const user of users) {
  user.posts = await Post.findAll({ userId: user.id }); // N queries
}

After:
const users = await User.findAll({
  include: [{ model: Post }] // 1 query with JOIN
});

```

### Step 5: Optimize Algorithms

#### Replace Inefficient Algorithm

```bash
/ck:cook [replace O(n²) algorithm with O(n) hash map solution]
```

**Before** (O(n²) - 523ms):
```javascript
function findDuplicates(items) {
  const duplicates = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
    for (let j = i + 1; j < items.length; j++) {
      if (items[i] === items[j]) {
        duplicates.push(items[i]);
      }
    }
  }
  return duplicates;
}
```

**After** (O(n) - 4ms):
```javascript
function findDuplicates(items) {
  const seen = new Set();
  const duplicates = new Set();

  for (const item of items) {
    if (seen.has(item)) {
      duplicates.add(item);
    } else {
      seen.add(item);
    }
  }

  return Array.from(duplicates);
}
```

**Result**: 99.2% faster (523ms → 4ms)

### Step 6: Async Operations

  ✓ Job processing logic

[2/4] Moving operations to queue...
  ✓ Email sending (was 890ms blocking)
  ✓ Report generation (was 2.3s blocking)
  ✓ Image processing (was 1.2s blocking)

[3/4] Implementing retry logic...
  ✓ Automatic retry on failure
  ✓ Exponential backoff
  ✓ Dead letter queue

[4/4] Results...

  ✓ Non-blocking operations
  ✓ Better error handling

✅ Background jobs implemented
```

#### Parallel Processing

```bash
/ck:cook [process multiple operations in parallel instead of sequential]
```

### Step 7: Database Connection Pool

```bash
/ck:cook [optimize database connection pooling]
```

**Configuration**:
```javascript
// Before: Default settings
pool: {
  max: 5,
  min: 0,
  idle: 10000
}

// After: Optimized
pool: {
  max: 20,          // More connections
  min: 5,           // Keep minimum ready
  idle: 30000,      // Longer idle time
  acquire: 60000,   // Longer acquire timeout
  evict: 1000       // Cleanup interval
}

Result: 45% faster during peak load
```

### Step 8: API Rate Limiting & Throttling

```bash
/ck:cook [implement intelligent rate limiting and request throttling]

## Performance Optimization Patterns

### Pattern 1: Progressive Enhancement

```bash
/ck:cook [implement progressive enhancement for slow connections]
```

### Pattern 2: Predictive Prefetching

```bash
/ck:cook [add predictive prefetching for likely user actions]
```

### Pattern 3: Service Worker Caching

```bash
/ck:cook [implement service worker for offline-first experience]
```

### Pattern 4: Database Read Replicas

```bash
/ck:cook [set up database read replicas for scaling reads]
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Measure First

Always profile before optimizing:
```bash
✅ Profile → Identify → Fix → Measure
❌ Guess → Optimize → Hope
```

### 2. Focus on Biggest Impact

Optimize high-impact issues first:
```
Priority order:
1. Critical path operations
2. High-frequency operations
3. User-facing operations
4. Background operations
```

### 3. Cache Aggressively

But invalidate correctly:
```javascript
// Cache layers
1. Browser cache (static assets)
2. CDN cache (global content)
3. Application cache (Redis)
4. Database query cache
5. Result memoization
```

### 4. Use Appropriate Data Structures

```javascript
✅ Hash map for lookups: O(1)
✅ Set for uniqueness: O(1)
✅ Binary search: O(log n)

❌ Array loops: O(n)
❌ Nested loops: O(n²)
```

### 5. Monitor Continuously

```bash
/ck:cook [implement continuous performance monitoring]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still Slow After Optimization

**Solution**:
```bash
# Re-profile
/ck:debug [deep performance analysis with detailed metrics]

# Check for new bottlenecks
# Optimize further
```

### Issue: Cache Not Hitting

**Solution**:
```bash
/ck:fix --quick [Redis cache hit rate below 50%]
```

### Issue: Memory Still Growing

**Solution**:
```bash
/ck:fix [memory still growing despite fixes]
```

### Issue: Database Timeout

**Solution**:
```bash
/ck:cook [increase connection pool and optimize slow queries]
```
